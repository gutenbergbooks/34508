<h3>WILLIAM CHAFFERS</h3>

<p class="center">Containing several hundred illustrations, some in colour, of rare,<br />
curious, and choice examples of Pottery and Porcelain from the<br />
earliest times to the beginning of the nineteenth century</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="smcaplc">NEW EDITION, REVISED AND EDITED BY</span><br />
H. M. CUNDALL, I.S.O., F.S.A.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">Royal 8vo, cloth extra, top edge gilt, to range with the same author&#8217;s<br />
&#8220;Marks and Monograms on Pottery&#8221;</p>

<div class="note">
<p><br />This important book, which was long out of print and scarce, is not
reprinted because of its rarity, but because it is an <i>indispensable</i>
companion to the same author&#8217;s &#8220;Marks and Monograms on Pottery and
Porcelain.&#8221;</p>

<p>As originally published in two volumes at 4 guineas, with the examples
reproduced by the Woodbury process, it was an inconvenient book for
reference, the examples being separated from the text. In this edition
the illustrations are all printed in the letterpress, and are seen in
conjunction with the history and description of the different potteries.</p>

<p>The book is not a bare reprint, but has been thoroughly edited, in many
cases new or additional specimen pieces given, and the references made
to the latest edition of the &#8220;Marks and Monograms,&#8221; so that the book is
of the utmost use for the present day.</p>

<p>This work was undertaken by Mr. H. M. Cundall, I.S.O., F.S.A., and no
pains have been spared to make it worthy to be in the hands of every
collector as well as every library.</p></div>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">As</span> &#8220;<span class="smcap">The Keramic Gallery</span>&#8221; by the late William Chaffers forms a pictorial
supplement to his book &#8220;<span class="smcap">Marks and Monograms on Pottery and Porcelain</span>,&#8221;
so likewise this work, &#8220;<span class="smcap">Handbook to Keramics</span>,&#8221; which is an abridged
edition of &#8220;<span class="smcap">The Keramic Gallery</span>,&#8221; is intended to form a companion volume
of illustrations to &#8220;<span class="smcap">The Collector&#8217;s Handbook of Marks and Monograms on
Pottery and Porcelain</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whilst it has been found necessary on account of their size to omit some
of the larger illustrations, which appear in the second edition of &#8220;<span class="smcap">The
Keramic Gallery</span>,&#8221; care has been taken to give representations, as far as
possible, of each individual kind of pottery and porcelain, which have
been produced in the various foreign and English manufactories from the
Renaissance period down to the middle of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Brief accounts, extracted from the larger volume, of the various
manufactories are also given, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> view to help in establishing the
period to which any specimen may belong.</p>

<p>It is hoped that this little work may prove to be of assistance to the
Collector in identifying those specimens of Keramics bearing no marks,
which may, from time to time, be brought under his notice.</p>

<h3>MAIOLICA</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>ITALY</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">The</span> painted pottery of Italy, ever since its introduction into that
country in the 15th century, has been called by the Italians themselves
<i>Maiolica</i>. In England it was in the 18th century called <i>Raphael ware</i>,
on account of an impression which existed that Raphael himself
condescended to paint on some of the ware. The idea probably originated
from the fact that many designs were reproduced on maiolica by the
keramic artists from engravings of Raphael and other great masters. The
best period of this pottery was, however, subsequent to his death, which
took place in 1520.</p>

<p>The term <i>maiolica</i> appears to be derived or rather corrupted from
Maiorca, one of the Balearic Islands, noted for its pottery from a very
early period. It was in the 16th century called <i>Maiorica</i>, and
subsequently <i>Maiolica</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

and must have had by far the most <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>trade, although no doubt many of the
specimens now attributed to this city were the works of other
manufactories; there are, however, a considerable number of signed and
dated pieces, and the style and touch of the principal artists engaged
there may easily be detected. The best known of all the keramic artists
of Urbino was Francesco Xanto Avelli da Rovigo, whose works are now so
highly appreciated; he usually painted after the designs and engravings
of Raphael and other great masters, but seldom adhered strictly to the
grouping of the originals; he also painted subjects from Virgil, Ovid,
and other poets. The marks which he placed upon his works consisted of
one or more initial letters of his name, F.X.A.R., but usually the X.
only, or sometimes Xanto, with the date. (See Fig. 1.)</p>

<h3>GUBBIO</h3>

<p>Gubbio, in the Duchy of Urbino, is known principally by the works of
Maestro Giorgio Andreoli, who seems to have monopolised the secret of
the ruby and yellow metallic lustre, with which he enriched not only his
own productions but put the finishing touches in lustre on the plates of
Xanto and other artists from Urbino, as well as from Castel Durante.
There is no doubt that the painting of the piece and the application of
the metallic lustre colours were two distinct operations, and that it
was painted and the colours fixed in the muffle kiln some months before
it was touched with the lustre pigments, and again subjected to another
baking. Giorgio was a statuary as well as a painter of maiolica, several
of his sculptures in marble being yet extant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>Another painter in lustre, of the school of M<sup>o</sup> Giorgio, has signed his
pieces with the letter N., which is supposed by some to be a monogram of
Vincenzio, the son of M<sup>o</sup> Giorgio; and a painter named Perestino, of
Gubbio, produced some very beautiful pieces, dated 1533 and 1536.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PESARO</h3>

<p>Guido Ubaldo II. della Rovere, who became Duke of Urbino in 1538, was a
patron of the <i>fabrique</i> of Pesaro. The maiolica with yellow lustre,
blue outlines and imbricated borders, which are assigned to Pesaro,
belong to the first part of the 16th century; many of these have
portraits and scrolls inscribed with the name of the person to whom they
were dedicated. When Passeri visited the town in 1718, there was only
one potter, making ordinary vessels. Some years after, in 1757, he sent
potters from Urbania and recommenced the manufacture.</p>

<p>According to M. A. Jacquemart, two artists of Lodi&mdash;Filippo Antonio
Callegari and Antonio Casali&mdash;were also established here about the
middle of the 18th century. The bowl and cover and dish, Fig. 9, painted
and gilt with flowers, are signed by them with their initials. There was
another <i>fabrique</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>established by Giuseppe Bertolucci of Urbania in
1757; Pietro Lei, a painter of Sassuolo, was engaged there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CASTEL DURANTE</h3>

<p>Castel Durante, a small town near Urbino, had a very extensive
manufactory of maiolica; most of its early productions of the beginning
of the 15th century are often confounded with those of Urbino, but there
is evidence enough to show the beautiful character of the decorations
employed there. Piccolpassi, director of a <i>bottega</i> for maiolica, at
Castel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> Durante, <i>circa</i> 1550, wrote a treatise on the art of making and
decorating it, whilst under the patronage of Guidobaldo II. The
manuscript is in the Art Library of the Victoria and Albert Museum. This
interesting work is illustrated with pen-and-ink sketches of all the
details of manufacture and patterns of the ware, and the prices at which
they were to be obtained; allusions are also made in it to other towns
celebrated for the same industry; and the principal forms of the vessels
are described by name.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i033a.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.&mdash;Vase.</span> <i>About</i> 1560.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i033b.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.&mdash;Plate.</span> <i>About</i> 1530.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the year 1635 the name of the <i>fabrique</i> was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
changed to <span class="smcap">Urbania</span> in compliment to Pope Urban VIII.; and in 1722 it was the only one which
remained in the Duchy of Urbino, where articles of utility alone were made.</p>

<p>A great trade was carried on in pharmacy vases or Vasi da Spezieria,
covered with grotesque heads, cornucopi&aelig;, &amp;c., designed and shaded with
light blue, touched with yellow, orange, brown and green, the patterns
being mostly in a bold style.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>FAENZA</h3>

<p>If not the most ancient, Faenza was one of the most celebrated of the
manufactories of maiolica in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> Italy. It was this town that gave to the
French the name by which they have to the present day distinguished
their enamelled pottery, as Spain had previously supplied the name to
Italy. Thus in Italy it was called <i>maiolica</i> from Maiorca, and in
France, <i>fa&iuml;ence</i> from Faenza. The earliest dated piece now extant is
probably a plate in the Mus&eacute;e de Cluny, dated 1475, made by Nicolaus de
Ragnolis. Another specimen, in the S&egrave;vres Museum, is inscribed &#8220;Nicolaus
Orsini, 1477&#8221;; and in the same collection is a plate, signed &#8220;Don
Giorgio, 1485,&#8221; probably by Maestro Giorgio.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>The products of this <i>fabrique</i> retained for a long time a special
character by which they are easily identified; at first the outlines of
the figures were very simple and formal; the yellow lustre does not
appear to have been adopted.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.&mdash;Plaque. Joseph sold by his Brethren.</span><br /><i>16th Century.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the 16th century a favourite decoration was grotesques and arabesques
in blue <i>cama&iuml;eu</i> on yellow ground, or alternately on the two colours
(see Fig. 15).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> The reverses of the Faenza plates are frequently light
blue, with concentric circles or a spiral line in a darker colour; when
white, with imbrications or zones alternately blue and yellow. Another
peculiarity by which the Faenza ware is known, is the presence of red.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>DIRUTA</h3>

<p>Many of the lustred pieces of maiolica, with light yellow lustre edged
with blue, which were attributed formerly to Pesaro, have been now
classed among the wares made at Diruta, from the circumstance of a plate
in the Pourtal&egrave;s Collection&mdash;subject, one of Ovid&#8217;s Metamorphoses,
being similarly decorated with the yellow lustre, and signed by El Frate
of Diruta, 1541. Some specimens have &#8220;<i>In Deruta</i>&#8221; inscribed at length;
others have simply the letter D with a bar through it; and early pieces
have the signature of the painter, El Frate, but without the yellow
lustre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>FORL&Igrave;</h3>

<p>According to Passeri there were <i>fabriques</i> of maiolica at Forl&igrave; in the
14th century. Its contiguity to Faenza exercised a great influence on
the decoration of the ware, and the patterns on the obverses and
reverses are similar. Fig. 18 has on the back &#8220;In la botega di M<sup>o</sup>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VITERBO, RAVENNA, AND TREVISO</h3>

<p>There were manufactories at these three places in the 16th century, but
few specimens of their productions now exist. (See Chaffers&#8217; <i>Marks and
Monograms</i>, p. 112.) The first named is illustrated (Fig. 19) by a
plateau; a man at the bottom holds a scroll inscribed &#8220;<span class="smcaplc">VITERBO DIOMED</span>,

<h3>CAFAGGIOLO</h3>

<p>This <i>fabrique</i>, established towards the end of the 15th century,
became very important, lasting probably throughout the 16th century. The
name is spelt in different ways, such as Chaffagiuolo, but Cafaggiolo is
the general form.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i041.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.&mdash;Plateau. St. George.</span><br /><i>Circa</i> 1520.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>Among the ornaments on this ware are frequently tablets with SPQR and
SPQF (Florentinus), and on several the motto &#8220;Semper,&#8221; adopted by Pietro
de&#8217; Medici in 1470, and continued by Lorenzo il Magnifico. The device of
a triangle and the word &#8220;Glovis,&#8221; meaning when read backwards &#8220;si volge&#8221;
(it turns), was used by Giuliano de&#8217; Medici in 1516, alluding to his
change of fortune.</p>

<p>Another characteristic of this <i>fabrique</i> is the dark blue background of
many of the pieces, and the method in which it was coarsely applied by
the brush.</p>

<p>Fig. 20 represents the St. George of Donatello, from the bronze statue
in the church of Or San Michele, at Florence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>SIENA</h3>

<p>The earliest specimens known of this important manufactory are some wall
or floor tiles of the commencement of the 16th century. They are of
maiolica, ornamented with polychrome designs of chimer&aelig;, dragons,
amorini, masks, birds, &amp;c., beautifully painted in brilliant colours,
especially orange and yellow on a black ground. They vary in shape,
being triangular, pentagonal, or square, to suit the geometrical designs
of the wall or floor they covered;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> the average diameter is 5 inches.
The plate in blue <i>cama&iuml;eu</i> on white ground, in the accompanying
illustration (Fig. 21) is signed on the reverse &#8220;fata in Siena da M<sup>o</sup>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After a long interval, the name of the town again appears on maiolica of
a very characteristic description, accompanied by the names of the
artists: Bartolomeo Terenze (or Terchi) Romano in 1727, and Ferdinando
Maria Campani, 1733 to 1747, the subjects being taken from Raphael,
Annibale Caracci, and other masters (see Figs. 22-24).</p>

<h3>PISA</h3>

<p>This city was, about the middle of the 16th century, the centre of a
considerable trade in the exportation of Italian fayence into Spain, and
especially to Valencia, in exchange for the golden metallic lustre ware
of that country. Antonio Beuter, a traveller, about 1550, praises the
fayence of Pisa as well as those of Pesaro and Castelli. A specimen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
bearing the name &#8220;<span class="smcaplc">PISA</span>,&#8221; a large vase of fine form, covered with
arabesques on white ground, was in the collection of the late Baron
Alphonse de Rothschild.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VENICE</h3>

<p>Little is known respecting the Venetian maiolica of the 16th and 17th
centuries, but numerous pieces exist bearing marks with Venice recorded
on them. These are specimens of the 17th century with a mark of a
fishhook, and from the long intervals between its use, it evidently
belongs to a <i>fabrique</i> and not a painter. As an example of Venetian
maiolica, <i>circa</i> 1700, see Fig. 25, a plate painted with an
architectural subject.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i046.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>In 1753, the Senate of Venice conceded to the brothers Bertolini the
establishment at Murano of a kiln for making fayence. But it did not
succeed so well as the promoters anticipated, and it was probably
discontinued about 1760, as the concession was annulled by a decree of
April 1763.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>NOVE</h3>

<p>In 1728, Giovanni Battista Antonibon established in the village of Nove,
near Bassano, a manufactory of earthenware, and in 1732 he opened a shop
in Venice for the sale of his wares. In 1741 the factory was still in a
prosperous state, and carried on by his son, Pasqual Antonibon. In 1766
Pasqual took his son, Giovanni Battista Antonibon, into partnership, and
in 1781 Sig. Parolini joined the concern, continuing the fabrication
with great success until 1802, when they leased the premises to Giovanni
Baroni, and the business was carried on under the name of <i>Fabbrica
Baroni Nove</i>. It was prosperous for a short time, and some beautiful
examples were produced.</p>

<p>Of the early maiolica made here little is known, but fayence of the 18th
century is occasionally met with, marked
with the letter F or Fl.</p>

<h3>PADUA</h3>

<p>In a street which still retains the name of <i>Boccaleri</i> (makers of
vases) were discovered traces of ancient potters&#8217; kilns, and some
triangular wall tiles, of blue and white maiolica alternately, of the
end of the 15th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> or beginning of the 16th century. Among these was a
plaque, 20 in. in diameter, of the Virgin and Child between two saints,
surrounded by angels. The subject is taken from a cartoon by Nicolo
Pizzolo, a painter of Padua and a pupil of Squarcione; on the summit of
the throne is written <span class="smcap">Nicoleti</span>, the name he usually adopted. The plaque
is now preserved in the Museum of that city.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CASTELLI</h3>

<p>The manufactory of Castelli, a small town in the Abruzzi, north of the
city of Naples, was still flourishing towards the end of the 17th
century. Francesco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> Saverio Grue, a man of letters and science, became
about this time director of this Neapolitan maiolica <i>fabrique</i>. The
ware was boldly ornamented with subjects, correctly designed and well
painted; sometimes the landscapes were delicately heightened with gold.
His sons and brothers continued to add lustre to his name for nearly a
century. Francesco Antonio Grue&#8217;s works, which have dates, range from
1677 to 1722, the subjects being principally scriptural and
mythological. Luigi Grue, about 1720-1740, painted landscapes and
figures. Ioanes Grue or Grua painted scriptural subjects from about 1730
to 1750. Saverio Grue was the re-inventor of gilding on fayence; some of
his pieces are dated 1749 and 1753. His earliest paintings are without
gold, consisting of classical subjects and mottoes on plaques. C. A.
Grue was a painter about the same time.</p>

<h3>NAPLES</h3>

<p>Maiolica was made in the city of Naples in the 17th century, but little
is known respecting it. Examples of the fayence of the 18th century are
frequently met with, signed FDV&mdash;F. del Vecchio; Giustiniani; the letter
N crowned, and sometimes the letters H.F.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>MONTE LUPO</h3>

<p>The plates and dishes of coarse heavy earthenware, rudely painted with
large caricature figures of soldiers and men in curious Italian costumes
of the 17th and 18th centuries, in menacing and warlike attitudes,
striding across the plates, holding swords, spears, and other weapons,
are usually attributed to Monte Lupo, near Florence. The manufactory is
still in existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>Fig. 31, is signed on the back &#8220;Raffaello Girolamo fecit Monte Lupo

<h3>MILAN</h3>

<p>No specimens can be identified of an earlier date than the 18th century.
The fayence is usually painted with grotesque figures, but sometimes
with flowers and scrolls in relief, also with Watteau or Chinese
subjects. (See Fig. 33.)</p>

<p>Some pieces, apparently of a later date, are from the manufactory of
Pasquale Rubati, and usually signed with his initials.</p>

<h3>TURIN</h3>

<p>That there was a manufactory of maiolica at Turin in the 16th century is
proved by a dish with pierced border, painted on the inside with a boy
carrying two birds on a long pole; it is marked underneath&mdash;Fatta in
Torino adi 12 di Set&#275;bre 1577 (see Fig. 35). The manufactory was in
existence in the first half of the 18th century and was under Royal
patronage, as a large dish which was in the collection of the Marquis
D&#8217;Azeglio is inscribed on the back of the rim: &#8220;Fabrica Reale di Torino
GR 1737.&#8221; In the centre of the reverse is a monogram composed of F. R.
T. (Fabbrica Reale Torino).</p>

<h3>FERRARA</h3>

<p>Alfonso I., Duke of Ferrara, himself occasionally worked in a room
attached to his palace, and is said to have discovered a fine white
colour, which was adopted by the <i>fabriques</i> of Urbino. He died in 1534.
His successor, Duke Alfonso II., summoned Camillo Fontana (son of the
celebrated Orazio Fontana of Urbino) in 1567 to give new life to the
manufactory. All the well-known pieces bearing the <i>impresa</i> of the
Duke, a flame of fire and the motto &#8220;<span class="smcaplc">ARDET ETERNUM</span>,&#8221; were produced at
this <i>fabrique</i>, about 1579. At a much later period, probably late in
the 17th century, there was still a manufactory here.</p>

<h3>BASSANO, <span class="smcap">near Venice</span></h3>

<p>A <i>fabrique</i> (according to V. Lazori) was founded here about 1540, by
Simone Marinoni, but it is not known how long it lasted. Later pieces of
the 17th century bear a certain resemblance to the Castelli ware. In
1728, a manufactory of maiolica was set on foot by the sisters Manardi,
which was continued in 1735 by Giovanni Antonio Caffo; and some time
after, but previous to 1753, another was carried on by Giovanni Maria
Salmazzo.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>GENOA</h3>

<p>Piccolpassi speaks of Genoa as a great mart for maiolica about the year
1540. He tells us the patterns painted&mdash;arabesques, leaves, landscapes,
&amp;c.&mdash;and the prices charged, but no specimens of this early date have
hitherto been identified. The fayence of the 18th century, however, is
of frequent occurrence; its decoration is much the same as that of
Savona, viz. rude and hasty sketches in blue <i>cama&iuml;eu</i>, sometimes with
small caricature figures in the style of Callot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> In consequence of
Genoa&#8217;s maritime position, the mark selected for this ware was a beacon,
by some erroneously called a lighthouse, from which some object is
suspended on a pole.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fig. 37, a bottle, painted in blue with birds and scroll ornaments, has
this mark.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>SAVONA</h3>

<p>The manufactory of Savona was founded in the 17th century at the village
of Albissola, situated on the coast, near Savona. The ware is generally
ornamented in blue on white ground, the designs are roughly executed,
and the mark, consisting of a shield of arms of the town, is often seen
on the reverse. There are some other marks attributed to Savona: a
double triangle with the letter S, called the &#8220;knot of Solomon&#8221;
(Salomone), the sun with G.S., the falcon mark, the tower mark, and the
anchor mark, so called from these emblems being depicted on the ware.
Fig. 38, a basket, perforated and with two handles, is rudely painted
with scrolls in yellow, blue, and green; in the centre is a cartouche
with the letters S.A.G.S.</p>

<h3>LORETO</h3>

<p>Although Santa Casa at Loreto is not strictly speaking a <i>fabrique</i> of
maiolica, yet maiolica is actually made within the precincts of the
sanctuary. Bowls are made of clay, mixed with the dust shaken from the
dress of the Virgin and walls of the sanctuary, and in this form are
preserved by the faithful as tokens of their visit to the shrine.</p>

<h3>SGRAFFIATO OR INCISED WARE</h3>

<p>The earthenware vessels with stanniferous enamel, called in Italy
<i>sgraffiato</i> ware, have been attributed to <span class="smcap">Citt&agrave; di Castello</span>. They are
engraved in outline and decorated <i>en engobe</i>&mdash;that is, the object
before being glazed is covered with a second coating of coloured slip
or <i>engobe</i>, on which is graved the ornament or design after it has been
merely dried by the air, leaving a sort of <i>champ lev&eacute;</i>, and afterwards
baked in the kiln. These fayence vases are generally enamelled in
yellow, green, and brown. Fig. 40, a bowl, is decorated with foliage, on
the stem are three lions seated, in full relief; round the bowl runs a
wreath of yellow flowers; and within is a man wrestling with a dragon,
surrounded by a wreath. There was a manufactory of this <i>sgraffiato</i>
ware at <span class="smcap">La Fratta</span>, near Perugia, which was continued down to a late
period. Fig. 42, a basket-shaped pot, has ornaments in relief. Similar
ware was also made at <span class="smcap">Pavia</span> in the 17th century.</p>

<h3>SPAIN</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">The</span> exact date of the introduction of enamelled pottery with
lustre-pigment into Spain is unknown, but the existence of manufactures
of &#8220;golden&#8221; pottery at Calatayud, in Aragon, is testified to by the
Mohammedan geographer Edrisi in the 12th century.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i063.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.&mdash;Azulejo.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hispano-Moresque period, which is best known to us from the numerous
specimens preserved to our time, commences with the 14th century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> when
the Alhambra of Granada was erected by the Moors.</p>

<p>The earlier pieces of the 14th and 15th centuries may be distinguished
by a golden yellow metallic lustre, and blue enamel on a white ground.
The designs are Moorish, consisting of diaper patterns, foliage,
fantastic and other animals, shields of arms of Spanish princes, &amp;c.,
and sometimes Arabic inscriptions, transformed into ornamental designs.</p>

<p>Fig. 43, a vase, is decorated with leaves and conventional flowers, in
reddish yellow lustre and blue.</p>

<p>The <i>azulejos</i> or enamelled tiles of the Alhambra, bearing passages from
the Koran, shields and other devices, are well known; they date from the
beginning of the 14th century (see Fig. 44).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Malaga.</span> The principal as well as the earliest centre for the manufacture
of fayence was in this city, and the finest known specimen of Moorish
fayence is the celebrated vase of the Alhambra, which is supposed to be
as early as the palace itself, viz. the 14th century, and was probably
made here. The colours of the decoration are a pure blue enamel,
surrounded or heightened with a yellow lustre on white ground.</p>

<p>Figs. 45 and 46 are other specimens of the Spanish lustre ware, with
shields of arms, of the 15th or 16th century.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Majorca</span> was the next in importance as regards its ancient manufacture,
but it must also have had a very extensive trade in fayence, for it was
exported to almost every part of the globe. Giovanni de&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> Bernardi da
Uzzano, writing in 1442 about the productions of the Balearic Isles,
says &#8220;<i>the fayence of Majorca has a very extensive sale in Italy</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i065.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 45.&mdash;Plateau.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the keramic art in Spain declined, the Arabic inscriptions, which
were perfect on the early vases like that of the Alhambra, were copied,
but the painter, not knowing their signification, employed them as
ornaments, until at last they became altogether confused and illegible.
The arabesques were no longer in such elegant taste, and large coats of
arms entirely filled the centres of vases and plates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span><span class="smcap">Valencia</span> was also celebrated for its fayence, which may be traced back
to Roman times, for Saguntum, now Murviedro, is mentioned by Pliny and
others as noted for its jasper red pottery. It is impossible to discover
the origin of the <i>lustred</i> pottery of Valencia, but it probably dates
from the beginning of the 15th century, when it became the most
important in Spain. The pieces attributed to this place have Christian
devices; many of them bear the inscription, &#8220;In principio erat Verbum
et Verbum erat apud Deum,&#8221; from the first chapter of St. John, and the
eagle displayed (not in an escutcheon as in the arms of Aragon), for St.
John was particularly venerated at Valencia. Of its earlier productions
of the Moorish period nothing is known.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47.&mdash;Dish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Valencia has from time immemorial been celebrated for its <i>azulejos</i> or
enamelled tiles. There are many houses of the 15th and 16th centuries
still existing in the ancient cities of Spain, the walls of whose rooms
are covered with tiles ornamented with borders, scrolls, and geometrical
designs. The celebrity of this manufacture is maintained to the present
day. Fayence of all descriptions was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>extensively made at Valencia
throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. Fig. 47, a dish, is blue and
white with a lion in the centre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manises</span>, near Valencia, was also celebrated from the 16th to the 18th
century. The decorations appear to be of Oriental design, executed for
the most part in a rich copper-coloured lustre. Some dishes with
copper-colour lustre have upon them a mark of an open hand, which may be
the emblem of the place, and are dated 1610 and 1611. Fig. 48, a vase,
is painted in lustre, with foliage, birds and animals, and with a rudely
executed shield of arms, seemingly of Sicily or Portugal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span><span class="smcap">Triana</span>, near Seville. There were several <i>fabriques</i> here, one for the
manufacture of spires or ornaments of earthenware, with which the gables
of the buildings were crowned; others for the <i>azulejos</i> or tiles so
much used in Spain, and for fayence vessels of all descriptions. Fig. 49
is a bottle in the form of a lady in the costume of the period of Louis
XIV., <i>en grande tenue</i>; inside the <i>fontange</i> or top-knot of the
headdress, which forms the spout, is written &#8220;Victor. I. Viva. Mi. Arno.

<h2>CONTINENTAL FAYENCE</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>FRANCE</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">Maiolica</span> and Fayence are essentially the same, being composed of the
same material and covered with a tin glaze or opaque white enamel, which
serves to hide the dingy colour of the clay, and forms a fine ground for
the reception of colours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint Porchaire.</span> All the earliest writers on the subject appear to have
thought that it was made in Touraine, and it was called <span class="smcap">Henri Deux</span> ware.</p>

<p>The ware next became known as <span class="smcap">Fa&iuml;ence d&#8217;Oiron</span>, but in 1888 it was
affirmed that the factory of this pottery was at Saint Porchaire.</p>

<p>The distinguishing characteristics of this curious ware are, in the
first place, the body, which is of a creamy white pipeclay, very compact
and of fine texture, so that it does not, like the ordinary fayence,
require an opaque white enamel, but merely a transparent glaze; and
secondly, that instead of being painted with enamel colours over the
surface, it is inlaid with coloured plates, in the same manner as the
<i>champ lev&eacute;</i> enamels or niello work in metal.</p>

<p>Fig. 53, a candlestick of cream-coloured ware, is inlaid with arabesques
and other patterns, in dark brown and reddish brown, with reliefs of
three boys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> tragic masks, shields of arms of France, and the cipher of
Henri II.; above are three terminal figures of satyrs; date about 1540.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 53.&mdash;Candlestick.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fig. 54, a <i>biberon</i>, is inlaid with interlaced bands and scrolls,
rosettes, guilloches, masks, &amp;c., in a reddish colour; a curved band on
the neck has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> row of ciphers, these being the letters A. M., elegantly
arranged as a decorative monogram, probably that of the Constable Anne
de Montmorency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span><span class="smcap">Beauvais</span> was celebrated for the manufacture of decorative pottery in the
14th century, and descriptions of cups of the <i>terre de Beauvais</i>
frequently occur in early inventories. Several specimens of it are still
in existence; they are of red, green, or blue glaze, with gothic
inscriptions and arms of various provinces of France in relief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apt.</span> The fabrication of fayence is said to have commenced here about the
middle of the 18th century, principally in imitation of jasper and
brocatelle marble. The manufactory of M. Bonnet was established about
1780, and marbled ware and vases of a yellow colour were produced.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Avignon.</span> A manufactory of pottery flourished here from about 1650 to
1780, but there were also potteries early in the 16th century. The
pottery is of a chocolate brown, with a fine metalloid glaze like bronze
or tortoiseshell. The ewers and bottles are of elegant forms, resembling
those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> Italy, sometimes perforated and ornamented with masks and
flowers in relief, or painted yellow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bernard Palissy</span>, born 1510, succeeded, after many years of diligent
research, in discovering the enamel which decorates his ware. His
earthenware, as well as his style of decoration and his beautiful
modelling, were quite original. The natural objects represented upon his
ware are true in form and colour, being mostly modelled from nature; the
shells are copied from tertiary fossils found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> Paris basin; the
fish are those of the Seine, and the reptiles and plants such as he
found in the environs of Paris.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i078.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 58.&mdash;Dish.</span><br /><i>16th Century.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevers.</span> The earliest evidence of the making of fayence at Nevers is the
foundation of a <i>fabrique</i> by Dominique Conrade, in the latter half of
the 16th century, which was carried on by his son and grandson. In 1652,
Pierre Custode established another <i>fabrique</i>, which was equally
successful, and seven generations of his family were employed in it.
Other manufactories were started in the 18th century.</p>

<p>The fayences of the first epoch, 1600 to 1660, have frequently been
confounded with Italian <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>maiolica, but a little attention will show the
points of difference. In the Nevers ware the figures are always yellow
on blue ground; the Italian figures are usually blue on yellow. At
Nevers red or metallic lustre was never employed, and the outlines are
always traced in manganese violet, never in purple or black. During the
second epoch, the ground was a peculiar lapis-lazuli blue, like the
Persian colour called <i>bleu de Perse</i>; it entirely covered the piece,
was spotted or painted with white, or sometimes in yellow and orange,
and decorated with flowers and birds. The Chinese patterns are in light
blue <i>en cama&iuml;eu</i>, sometimes intermixed with a sort of brown lilac.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rouen.</span> There was a manufactory of pottery at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> Rouen early in the 16th
century, and towards the end of the next century there were many
establishments. At the commencement of the 18th century, the Chinese
style pervaded all the Rouen fayence, but it was transformed or
travestied and possessed a special physiognomy; the subjects were
landscapes and buildings with figures, fantastic birds, dragons, &amp;c., in
blue, green, yellow, and red, bordered with the square Chinese
ornaments. At a later date the decoration consists principally of
flowers issuing from cornucopi&aelig; and rococo ornaments; this sort of style
is called in France &#8220;<i>&agrave; la corne</i>.&#8221; The paste of the Rouen fayence is
heavier and thicker than that of Delft, but the designs and ornaments
are full of taste, decorated in blue <i>cama&iuml;eu</i> and in polychrome, some
in the style of Nevers, with white on <i>bleu de Perse</i>, but of paler
colour. The pieces were frequently of large size, and included

established by Charles Fran&ccedil;ois Hannong about 1709. It was called in
France &#8220;poterie du Rhin,&#8221; and is of a peculiar character, and easily
known, being generally decorated with flowers and scrolls in red, rose
colour, and green. Charles F. Hannong was succeeded by his sons Paul
and Balthasar. The former took charge of the Strassburg works, and the
latter the factory which had been started at Hagenau. The Strassburg
fayence works were closed in 1780.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moustiers.</span> The products of the Moustiers <i>fabriques</i> may be divided into
three periods:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st Epoch. Towards the end of the 17th century. The subjects are hunting
scenes, &amp;c., painted in blue; champ&ecirc;tre scenes and figures in costumes
of the period of Louis XIV.; and mythological and biblical subjects with
arabesque borders. The outlines are sometimes lightly indicated in
violet of manganese.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i087.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.&mdash;Plateau.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2nd Epoch. From the commencement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> 18th century to about 1745. The
specimens of this period are in blue <i>cama&iuml;eu</i> with highly finished and
graceful interlaced patterns, among which are cupids, satyrs, nymphs,
terminal figures, flowers, masks, &amp;c.; canopies with draperies resting
upon consoles, vases, fountains, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3rd Epoch. From 1745 to 1789. The fayence is mostly painted in
polychrome; the colours are blue, brown, yellow, green, and violet. The
decorations are flowers, fruit, and foliage, and sometimes mythological
subjects. Other patterns of this period consist of grotesque figures,
and caricatures. The outlines of the designs were transferred to the
surface of the ware by means of paper patterns, pricked with a fine
needle and powdered over with charcoal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marseilles.</span> The manufacture of fayence at Marseilles, and elsewhere in
the South of France, was in activity early in the 17th century. A little
after 1750, twelve <i>fabriques</i> of pottery were in existence. In 1790
there were eleven manufactories existing, but most of them ceased about
1793, on account of the Treaty of Commerce with England. The Revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of 1793 gave an additional blow to the keramic industry of Marseilles.
In 1805 there were only three factories at work, employing twenty hands.
In 1809 only one remained.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i091.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 74.&mdash;Tureen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fayence is much the same in character as that of Moustiers, and
sometimes resembles that of Strassburg. The decorations are frequently
in red or green, sometimes with Chinese designs. There is one
peculiarity about the Marseillaise fayence which at once fixes its
identity, and this is, three green leaves or marks painted on the backs
of plates and dishes to hide the imperfections in the enamel caused by
the <i>pernettes</i> or points of support on which they rested in the kiln.
There is also a great resemblance between the early ware made here and
at Genoa, in consequence of the emigration of many workmen. We learn
from a complaint made on the subject by the potters of Marseilles to the
Intendant of Provence in 1762, from which it seems they took a great
number of apprentices at very low wages, and the wages were paid in
fayence, which mode of payment they said deteriorated the quality, and
caused the workmen to emigrate to Genoa. Also they complained that great
quantities of Genoese fayence were imported into Languedoc and Provence,
and spread over France, which was absolutely ruinous to the trade of the
two provinces, and especially to Marseilles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sinceny</span> in Picardy. A manufactory was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>established here in 1733, by Jean
Baptiste de Fayard, Gouverneur de Chaunay et Seigneur de Sinceny. Dr.
Warmont (<i>Recherches Historiques sur les fa&iuml;ences de Sinceny, &amp;c.</i>,
Paris, 1864) divides the products of this manufactory into three
periods:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">1. Rouennaise, 1734 to 1775.<br />
2. Fa&iuml;ence au feu de r&eacute;verb&egrave;re, 1775 to 1789.<br />
3. D&eacute;cadence de l&#8217;Art, 1789 to 1864.</p>

<p>The earliest pieces were painted in blue; the next in blue touched with
red or green and yellow, decorated with <i>lambrequins</i> (mantlings), <i>&agrave; la
corne</i> (cornucopi&aelig;), birds, and butterflies. Chinese figures were
doubtless stencilled by pricked papers and charcoal powder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i093.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 75.&mdash;Bowl and Cover.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>About 1775 a great improvement was perceptible in the fayence of
Sinceny; the paste became finer in quality, the colours brighter and
more varied, in more exact imitation of the porcelain of Japan. This was
accomplished by what is called <i>le feu de r&eacute;verb&egrave;re</i>, in
contradistinction to the old process <i>au grand feu</i>; the latter included
only one baking, while in the other the ware was placed a second time in
the kiln, and the pigments were not exposed to so great a heat, which
allowed the employment of brighter colours. Table services decorated in
polychrome, with branches of roses, sometimes in green <i>cama&iuml;eu</i>;
delicate wicker baskets, watch stands, &amp;c., were produced; they were
painted with Chinese figures, rococo scrolls, and other ornaments. From
1790 the fayence <i>au feu de r&eacute;verb&egrave;re</i> was largely discontinued on
account of its expensive character and the introduction of English ware
at a lower price; but still, both descriptions were occasionally made.</p>

<p>Fig. 75 is a bowl and cover, painted in colours inside with a coronet,
supported by two cupids on clouds with a flaming heart beneath, 18th
century.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lun&eacute;ville.</span> Founded in 1731 by Jacques Chambrette, it was called <i>La
Manufacture Stanislas</i>; Jacques was succeeded by his son Gabriel and his
son-in-law Charles Loyal. They made fayence of blue decoration like
Nevers, and sometimes with rose and green colours like the old
Strassburg ware. Large figures of lions, dogs, and other animals, of
natural size, are sometimes met with.</p>

d&#8217;Aprey. About 1780 it was conducted by M. Vilhault, who made a superior
kind of fayence. The early style is that of Strassburg with rose colour,
green and yellow predominating.</p>

Palissy, and have frequently been sold as such.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toulouse.</span> Established in the 18th century. The ware is very similar in
style to early Rouen pottery. A large hunting bottle, with loops for
suspension, painted with blue flowers, and bearing round the neck the
inscription &#8220;Laurens Basso a Toulousa Le 14 Ma&yuml; 1756,&#8221; was formerly in
the possession of the late Mr. C. W. Reynolds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Niderviller.</span><small><a name="f2.1" id="f2.1" href="#f2">[2]</a></small> Established in 1760, by Jean Louis, Baron Beyerl&eacute;. The
ware is in the German style, potters from Germany having been employed
in its production, and is remarkable for the richness and delicacy of
its decoration, which most frequently consists of flowers in bouquets
and garlands. His fayence figures and groups are well modelled. About
1780,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> four years before Beyerl&eacute;&#8217;s death, the factory was purchased by
General Count Custine, and carried on by him under M. Lanfray,
principally for the manufacture of porcelain, which will be subsequently
referred to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span><span class="smcap">Douai.</span> Two brothers of the name of Leech, from England, were engaged, in
1782, by M. George Bris, of Douai, to superintend the manufacture of
English pottery on a large scale, in a factory (now a Normal School) in
the Rue des Carmes. It was one of the first of the kind established in
France. The chief workmen, who came originally from England, instructed
pupils, who carried the new process to Chantilly, Forges, and other
places in France.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vincennes.</span> In 1768 M. Maurin des Abiez undertook a manufacture of
fayence in the manner of Strassburg, it being well known that there did
not exist in France any fayence comparable to it in beauty and solidity;
he had purchased the secret, and brought to Paris a staff of workmen who
had been engaged at Strassburg. He acquired possession of the Ch&acirc;teau de
Vincennes for twenty years. Pierre Antoine Hannong was engaged as
director, and the works were carried on for four years, until 1771, when
the factory got into difficulties and was closed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarreguemines.</span><small><a name="f3.1" id="f3.1" href="#f3">[3]</a></small> Established about 1770 by Paul Utzschneider. The
beautiful fayence produced here is in imitation of porphyry, jasper,
granite, and other variegated hard marbles, and was sometimes cut and
polished by the lathe; it was also made with white raised figures on
blue in the style of Wedgwood, and a third kind was red ware like the
Japanese. The name is impressed on the ware.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span><span class="smcap">St. Amand-les-Eaux</span>, near Valenciennes. Founded about 1750 by M. Fauquet,
and continued by his son. The latter occupied himself especially with
the gilding of his ware, which gave his neighbours the opportunity of
saying he melted all his louis-d&#8217;ors in making his experiments and
ruined himself. In the revolution of 1789 he emigrated, and all his
goods were confiscated. In 1807 he attempted to revive the <i>fabrique</i>,
and advertised that the St. Amand works were in full activity, making
white fayence in the style of Rouen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sceaux Penthi&egrave;vre.</span> In 1753, Jacques de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> Chapelle established a
manufactory of a particular sort of fayence, of which he alone possessed
the secret. The ware is in the style of Strassburg, its prevailing
colours being pink and green; it is painted with flowers, but more
carefully finished, and with landscapes and other forms of decoration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bourg-la-Reine.</span> Established in 1773 by Messrs. Jacques and Jullien, who
removed hither from Mennecy. The early ware is very similar to that of
Sceaux. Besides the white fayence for domestic use, more artistic pieces
were produced, painted on the enamel after it had received a slight
baking; this ware is principally in imitation of the Italian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Creil.</span> A manufactory of fine fayence, worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> in the 18th century by M.

transferred prints on to the ware.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montereau.</span> In 1775, Messrs. Clark, Shaw, &amp; Co., obtained letters patent
to carry on a manufactory of English fayence, called Queen&#8217;s ware, from
clay found in the vicinity. This ware had a very extensive sale, and
dealt a severe blow to the manufacture of French fayence. It soon spread
over France, and was extensively made at Toulouse, Creil, Sarreguemines,
and other places.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lille.</span> A manufactory of fayence, was founded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> in 1696, by Jacques
Feburier, of Tournai, and Jean Bossu, of Ghent, who made a ware <i>&agrave; la

<p>Another important manufactory of fayence was established in 1711, by
Barth&eacute;lemy Dorez and Pierre Palissier; it continued in active work for
nearly a century. A third fayence manufactory was founded in 1740 by J.
Masquelier, and was continued in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> the same family until 1827. A fourth
was established in 1744, by M. Chanou, who made a brown earthenware
called <i>terre du St. Esprit</i>, in the English fashion. There were also
two other factories here in the 18th century.</p>

<h3>GERMANY</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">The</span> pottery of Germany consists of two distinct classes: the fayence
with opaque white stanniferous glaze, and that which to a great extent
is called in England stoneware, in Germany <i>Steingut</i>, and in France
<i>gr&egrave;s</i> or sandstone. These epithets exactly describe the quality of the
latter ware. It is very serviceable for domestic utensils, such as
drinking bottles and vessels of everyday use, and is covered with a thin
transparent glaze, effected by throwing common salt into the kiln when
the ware is nearly baked&mdash;the salt vaporised by the heat surrounds the
vessels, and acting upon the silica of their surfaces produces a thin
gloss of silicate of soda over the ware, rendering it perfectly
impervious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nuremberg</span> (<i>N&uuml;rnberg</i>). The celebrated Veit Hirschvogel, of
Schlettstadt, was born in 1441, and died in 1525; he was a great potter,
contemporary with Luca della Robbia, of Florence. The early pieces of
pottery are somewhat like maiolica, but the colours are brighter, green
predominating in many specimens; figures in relief in niches are
frequently seen on vases. Several chimney-pieces of this ware of the
15th century are still in existence, one is in the castle of Salzburg,
and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> pieces treasured up in museums are supposed to have been made
by Hirschvogel himself. The Nuremberg pottery of the 16th and 17th
centuries is not uncommon. Hirschvogel was succeeded by his sons and a
host of continuators. Fayence of the 18th century is also met with,
painted with scriptural subjects, sometimes in blue <i>cama&iuml;eu</i>, sometimes in other colours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leipzig.</span> In the convent of St. Paul, which was built in 1207, there was
a frieze of bricks, covered with tin enamel glaze, representing in
relief the heads of Saints and Apostles, 20 in. by 15 in., 2&#189; in.
thick. On the demolition of the convent a selection of these was
deposited in the Dresden Museum; they are of Byzantine character, in
green enamel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> shaded with black; the hair, beard, and eyes of the
figures are coloured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strehla.</span> A manufactory for earthenware was in existence here for many

a life-size figure of Moses, ornamented with eight plaques of religious
subjects and figures of the four Evangelists, bearing the name of the

<p><span class="smcap">Oberdorf.</span> A factory was carried on by a potter named Hans Seltzman; a
very fine stove made by him, with an inscription and dated 1514, is in
the Palace at F&uuml;ssen, in Bavaria. Many other places throughout Germany
were equally famous in the 16th and 17th centuries, for the manufacture
of stoves, as <span class="smcap">Augsburg</span>, <span class="smcap">Memmingen</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bayreuth.</span> The manufacture of a brown stoneware with Renaissance
medallions, arabesques, &amp;c., in relief flourished here in the 16th
century. At a later period, fine fayence was produced, painted in blue
<i>cama&iuml;eu</i>. The designs are delicately traced with a brush on a fine
paste; the forms are canettes, jardini&egrave;res, &amp;c. At the end of the 18th
century a <i>fabrique</i> of fayence was carried on by a Herr Schmidt, who
assiduously copied the English ware; there are specimens in the S&egrave;vres
Museum bearing the counterfeit mark of &#8220;Wedgwood.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cologne</span> (<i>K&ouml;ln</i>). The stoneware made here in the 16th century is better
known throughout Europe than any other description of pottery; its
durability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> for domestic uses and the elegant character of its
ornamentation in relief, caused it to be sought for everywhere. The
<i>gr&egrave;s de Cologne</i> has been confounded with the <i>gr&egrave;s de Flandres</i>, which
latter name is given erroneously and indiscriminately to all stoneware
of German manufacture, notwithstanding the German inscriptions the
pieces bear and the arms of German cities and families. The best and
most highly finished decorative <i>gr&egrave;s</i> or stoneware cruches were
undoubtedly made in Germany, if not at Cologne. The clay for making the
Cologne ware came from Langerwehe between D&uuml;ren and Aix-la-Chapelle. The
manufactory was not actually in Cologne, but in the vicinity, possibly
at <span class="smcap">Frechen</span>, and at <span class="smcap">Lauenstein</span>, where a factory was established in the
18th century.</p>

<p>There were also factories at <span class="smcap">Siegburg</span> and <span class="smcap">Limburg</span>.</p>

<p>All the ware was made in moulds, and it must be borne in mind that the
vessels were not always made at the date indicated upon them, for the
moulds were used successively through a series of years, and it is no
uncommon occurrence to find two different dates upon the same piece.
Some of the finest specimens known bear the name of Baldem Mennicken, a
potter dwelling at <span class="smcap">Raeren</span> in the ancient Duchy of Limburg, which town
until the treaty of 1814 was part of Holland, and it is probable that
the stoneware produced here indicates the origin of <i>gr&egrave;s de Flandres</i>.</p>

centuries. The products of the 18th century are distinguished by
ornaments in relief, flowers, coats of arms, &amp;c., sometimes gilt. At the
present time an extensive trade is still carried on in the manufacture
of chocolate and coffee pots, usually covered with a brown glaze, and
lined with white. There is preserved a monster coffee-pot, 15 feet high,

<p><span class="smcap">Scherzheim</span>, in W&uuml;rtemberg. The Wintergursts, father and son, were
celebrated potters here, and made fayence from the beginning of the 17th
century; it is from their manufactory that the table services, of which
each piece represents an animal or a vegetable, were made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lauenstein</span>, near Coblenz. A manufactory was established in 1760; the
<i>gr&egrave;s</i> or stoneware made here was of grey and blue, ornamented with
incuse patterns; it was made in large quantities, and carried by the
Rhine boats to the markets in Holland, where it met with a ready sale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H&ouml;chst</span>, near Mainz. Enamelled fayence was made here in the beginning of
the 18th century, at a factory founded by Gelz of Frankfort. The
manufactory ceased in 1794, but a potter named Dahl established one in
the vicinity. He made statuettes and other ornaments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dresden.</span> A manufactory was established at Meissen, on the Elbe, about 12
miles from Dresden, by Augustus II., King of Poland and Elector of
Saxony, for the manufacture of hard paste, or true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> porcelain. The
experiments of Tschirnhaus and B&ouml;ttcher commenced about 1706; to the
latter is attributed the invention of hard paste. His first attempt
produced a red ware, like jasper, which was cut and polished by the
lapidary and gilt by the goldsmith. It was made from a kind of brown
clay found at Meissen. This red ware, made by B&ouml;ttcher, was a fine
stoneware, having opacity, grain, and toughness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankenthal.</span> Paul Hannong, driven from Strassburg in 1753, in
consequence of the Vincennes monopoly, founded a manufactory here in the
following year for hard paste porcelain; he also made great quantities
of fayence, usually decorated with flowers, as at Strassburg. It was
called &#8220;Poterie du Rhin.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arnstadt</span> (Gotha). A factory was established here about the middle of the

<p><span class="smcap">Kiel</span> was noted for its fayence about 1770; the factory was under the
direction of J. Buchwald, who had been master potter at Marieberg, 1761
to 1765; a few years after, probably in 1767 or 1768, he became director
of the Kiel manufactory. The paintings of landscapes and flowers in
colours are well finished.</p>

<h3>HOLLAND AND LUXEMBURG</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>HOLLAND</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">Delft,</span> a town between the Hague and Rotterdam, was celebrated for its
earthenware at a very early period. The exact date of its commencement
is not known, but there is a record of a certain Herman Pietersz, a
fayence maker, being married in 1584, consequently pottery was being
made in the town towards the end of the 16th century. At this period the
decorated Dutch pottery showed Italian influence in its design, and it
is recorded that a painter on pottery named Vroom studied his art in
Italy.</p>

<p>After the middle of the 17th century the industry increased rapidly, and
reached its greatest prosperity about 1680, when there were about thirty
different factories, and the ware was decorated by highly skilled
artists. No one was allowed to establish a factory unless he had
obtained a licence from the Guild of S<sup>t</sup>. Luc.</p>

<p>To this period belong famous potters, such as P. J. Van Kessel of &#8220;The
Metal Pot&#8221;; Abram de Kooge of &#8220;The Old Moor&#8217;s Head,&#8221; who decorated
landscapes in blue <i>cama&iuml;eu</i>; and Albrecht de Keizer, with his two
sons-in-law, Jacob and Adrian Pynaker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> of &#8220;The Three Porcelain
Bottles,&#8221; who were the first to imitate oriental porcelain. Other
potters of note at this time were the Eenhorns, father and two sons, the
Kleftyns, and the five Kams.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i123.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 99.&mdash;Cruche.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>By the middle of the 18th century, owing to the competition of English
pottery, the Delft industry was already on the wane. In 1780 the
factories were reduced to one half their former number, and by 1808 only
seven existed. All these gradually succumbed, and now only one factory,
&#8220;The Old Porcelain Bottle,&#8221; remains.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i124.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 100.&mdash;Teapot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The forms of the Delft ware are very varied; among other curious efforts
the potters produced musical instruments. There are four fayence violins
extant, all painted in blue <i>cama&iuml;eu</i>, with figures in Dutch costume of
the 17th century, dancing and singing, musicians and kermess scenes, in
the manner of Gerard Lairesse, with cupids and Renaissance ornaments as borders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>The decorated pieces of Ter Himpelen, although rarely signed, are much
prized; he painted fairs and marine subjects on square plaques, about
the year 1650. So also are those of Piet Viseer, a celebrated colourist,
who flourished about 1750; and of Van Domelaar, who painted Chinese
landscapes, &amp;c., about 1580.</p>

<p>Fig. 102, a plate painted with figures in blue, is one of a set of

<p><span class="smcap">Utrecht.</span> There was a manufactory of tiles here, founded in 1760; they
were decorated in blue or violet, <i>en cama&iuml;eu</i>, in imitation of Delft;
the manufactory was closed in 1855.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amsterdam.</span> A German Jew of Breslau, named Hartog, known as Hartog Van
Laun, and another, named Brandeis, established a manufactory of fayence
near the gate of Weesp, at Amsterdam. The ware is heavy, not very
artistic, and usually in blue <i>cama&iuml;eu</i>. Fig. 103, a fruit dish, is
painted in blue, with a man and woman seated.</p>

parish of Amstelveen, near Amsterdam; it lasted ten years. The Barons
Van Haeren and Van Palland were the proprietors, and Ariel Blankers was
the director. The fayence, though heavy, was of a fine white enamel and
of good forms; besides table and tea services, groups of birds, modelled
from nature, statuettes, &amp;c., were made.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>LUXEMBURG</h3>

<p>An important <i>fabrique</i> was established at Luxemburg by the brothers
Boch, in 1767, who had removed from Audun le Riche in France. They made
various descriptions of earthenware, as well as fine fayence, and
largely imitated the English Queen&#8217;s ware.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>RUSSIA</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">St. Petersburg.</span> About the year 1700, Peter the Great, during his stay at
Saardam, induced some potters of Delft to emigrate to St. Petersburg,
where he established a manufactory. We have no information on the
subject, except a notice of it in the &#8220;<i>Connaissances Politiques</i>,&#8221; of
Beausobre, published at Riga in 1773: &#8220;There is also among the porcelain
manufactories at St. Petersburg a <i>fabrique</i> of fayence, on the other
side of the Neva, where they make every description of vessels of
correct design and in good taste. A private gentleman of Revel has also
established at his own cost, near this city, a <i>fabrique</i> of fayence,
and has obtained painters and potters from Germany.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>SWEDEN</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">R&ouml;rstrand</span>, a suburb of Stockholm, where a factory for earthenware was
established in 1726. The works were at first under the direction of Jean
Wolf. He was succeeded by C. C. H&uuml;nger. In 1772 they were managed by
Nordenstople, and later by Geyer.</p>

<h2>CONTINENTAL PORCELAIN</h2>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">Porcelain</span> has this distinguishing characteristic, that when held up to a
strong light it appears translucent, unlike fayence, which is perfectly
opaque. Its fracture is hard and white internally, like a broken piece
of alabaster.</p>

<p>Porcelain of soft paste has the appearance of an unctuous white enamel
like cream; it is also to the touch of a soft, warm, and soapy nature,
something like the surface of fine fayence. The <i>p&acirc;te tendre</i> is also
soft in another sense, being unable to bear so great a degree of heat in
the furnace as hard porcelain. The soft paste may, therefore, be easily
cut or scratched with a steel point or a file, which would have no
effect upon the hard paste; it is consequently liable to become much
scratched by frequent use. The hard paste or true porcelain is of the
whiteness of milk; it feels to the touch of a hard and cold nature, and
is somewhat heavier than the soft; underneath the plates and other
pieces the rim or edge is left unpolished, or without glaze.</p>

<p>The painting upon porcelain is executed after the ware has been baked.
Whilst in a biscuit state, the piece to be painted is dipped into a
diluted glaze; it readily absorbs the water, leaving on the surface a
thin coating of components which quickly dries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> into a solid shell,
uniformly thick over all its parts, and sufficiently firm to bear
handling without being rubbed off during removal into the seggar or case
which protects it in the kiln.</p>

<p>The amateur must be upon his guard in collecting porcelain, and not
place too much reliance on the marks which he may find upon the ware.
When the mark is not indented on the paste, or baked with the porcelain
when at its greatest heat (<i>au grand feu</i>), it gives no guarantee of its
genuineness. The mark was nearly always affixed before glazing. It is
necessary in forming a correct judgment of the authenticity of a piece
of valuable china, such as S&egrave;vres, that many things be taken into
consideration: First, above all it is most important to be satisfied
whether the porcelain be of hard or soft paste, and whether such
description of paste was made at the particular epoch represented by the
mark; then, if the decoration be in keeping with the style adopted at
the time indicated, the colours, the finish, and various other <i>indicia</i>
must also be taken into consideration.</p>

<h3>ITALY</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">Florence.</span> The first successful attempt in Europe to imitate porcelain
was made at Florence as early as 1580, under the auspices of Francesco
I. de&#8217; Medici, but it was not so hard as that of China; that is to say,
it was not composed of <i>kaolin</i> and <i>petuntse</i>, but was a soft paste and
<i>translucent</i>, which is one of the principal tests of porcelain. For
some reason, the manufacture of this porcelain was abandoned after the
death of the inventor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Naples&mdash;Capo di Monte.</span> This manufactory was founded by Charles III. in
1736. It is considered of native origin, as the art, which was kept so
profound a secret in Dresden, could, at that early period, have scarcely
had time to be introduced here, and the char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>acter of its productions
are also essentially different. The king himself took great interest in
it, and is said to have worked occasionally in the manufactory. The
beautiful Capo di Monte services and groups in coloured relief are of
the second period, <i>circa</i> 1760.</p>

porcelain at Vinovo or Vineuf in 1770. Attempts in this direction had
been previously made, but they were unsuccessful, and it was not until
Gioanetti applied himself to the manufacture that it succeeded. The ware
was noted for its fine grain and the whiteness of its glaze, as well as
for the colours employed in its decoration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Venice.</span> Porcelain of soft paste was made here probably about 1720.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Casa eccellentissima Vezzi&#8221; was founded by Francesco Vezzi, a
goldsmith of Venice. He invested the sum of 30,000 ducats in a porcelain
company, amongst whose shareholders were Luca Mantovani and others. The
site of the Vezzi manufactory of porcelain was at S. Nicolo in Venice.
How long after Vezzi&#8217;s death it was carried on does not appear, but
judging from the statements made to the Senate in 1765, it did not long
survive him, and the secret of his process for making porcelain had
evidently not been disclosed.</p>

<p>Materials for making porcelain were to be obtained in the Venetian
dominions, but not such as to produce the <i>hard</i> or Oriental porcelain;
they were therefore procured from Saxony, as were probably also some of
the workmen, which will account for the fact that the &#8220;Casa
eccellentissima Vezzi&#8221; produced both <i>hard</i> and <i>soft</i> paste.</p>

<p>The pieces made at the Vezzi manufactory are painted with masquerades,
grotesque Chinese figures and decorations in relief, flowers, birds,
arabesques, and geometrical patterns and colours, statuettes, &amp;c.,
especially in the Venetian red which pervades all the decorations, the
handles, borders, and mouldings being sometimes covered with silver or
platinum, producing the effect of oxidised metal mountings. Another
striking peculiarity in the decoration of porcelain of this period is a
border of black or coloured diaper work formed by crossed lines, having
in the interstices small gilt points or crosses bordered by scrolls.
These specimens are mostly of hard paste in the form of bowls, plates,
tureens, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A beautiful example of this porcelain is represented in Fig. 118, a vase

marks and interlaced bands, is shown on the cover; the edges, knob, and
flutings are raised and plated with silver or platinum.</p>

<p>After the Vezzi manufactory had ceased to exist we have no documents to
prove that any efforts were made to introduce the manufacture of
porcelain into Venice until December 1757, when a petition was presented
to the Venetian College by Frederick Hewelcke &amp; Co., who stated that the
sale introduced and directed by them in Dresden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> of Saxon porcelain had
been carried on in a very flourishing manner, but that in consequence of
the then existing war (the Seven Years&#8217; War, which commenced in 1756),
they had been obliged to abandon Saxony and to seek refuge in a foreign
country.</p>

<p>On the 18th of March 1758, a decree granted to the Hewelckes the
privileges they had requested. It seems that the undertaking proved
eventually to be unfortunate, and at the termination of that war, which
had brought them to Venice, they returned to their native country.</p>

<p>In 1765, the Senate granted to Giminiano Cozzi, in the Contrada di San
Giobbe, Venice, protection and pecuniary assistance in carrying out a
manufacture of porcelain. Cozzi&#8217;s first efforts were directed towards
the imitation of the Oriental ware; and a very large trade was carried
on by him for nearly fifty years. He produced statuettes in biscuit, in
glazed white porcelain, and coloured groups, vases, &amp;c. The gilding on
Cozzi&#8217;s porcelain is especially fine, the pure gold of the sequin having
been used in its decoration.</p>

<p>The manufactory ceased to exist in 1812.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nove.</span> The manufacture of porcelain at Nove may be traced back as far as
the 12th January 1752, when Pasqual Antonibon brought from Dresden a
certain Sigismund Fischer to construct a furnace for making porcelain in
the Saxon style.</p>

<p>From this time forward he continued his experiments, and must have made
great progress in the art, for in February 1761 he had three furnaces,
of which one was for Saxon (<i>ad uso di Sassonia</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> the other two for
French porcelain (<i>ad uso di Francia</i>).</p>

<p>In 1762, Antonibon submitted specimens of his porcelain to the Board of
Trade, and petitioned that the patent rights which had been conceded to
Hewelcke should be extended to him. At that time, the report states,
Antonibon had at Nove a manufactory, rich in buildings, machinery, and
tools. The capital embarked in it was estimated at 80,000 ducats, and so
great was the sale of his products that he gave employment to 150 men
and their families, in addition to 100 people employed in his retail
business, carried on at his three shops in Venice. This extensive
manufactory was, however, principally for maiolica.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 120.&mdash;Jardini&egrave;re.</span><br /><i>By</i> <span class="smcap">Antonibon</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the 7th April 1763, a decree was made in his favour; and he appears
to have set earnestly to work in his manufacture of porcelain. His
competitor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> Hewelcke, shortly after deserted Venice; but he had a more
formidable rival in Giminiano Cozzi, who obtained a decree for making
porcelain in 1765, in which Pasqual Antonibon&#8217;s manufacture is noticed,
the Senate declaring it to be the duty of the magistrate to make such
arrangements as would lead to an amicable understanding between the
rival manufacturers and their workmen.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i146.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pasqual Antonibon and his son Giovanni Battista<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> continued the
fabrication of porcelain until the 6th February 1781, when they entered
into partnership with Signor Parolini. The same manufacture, <i>con sommo
onore dell&#8217;arte</i>, was continued by them until the 6th February 1802,
when it was leased to Giovanni Baroni, who produced some very charming
pieces both in form and decoration; but in a few years, from being badly
conducted, it began to fall off, and by degrees it went to decay and was
abandoned. The &#8220;Fabbrica Baroni,&#8221; however, lingered on for more than
twenty years.</p>

<p>On 21st May 1825, the old firm of &#8220;Pasqual Antonibon and Sons&#8221; resumed
the works, the actual proprietors being Gio. Batt. Antonibon and his son
Francesco; they continued the manufacture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> porcelain until 1835, but
all their efforts to sustain it were ineffectual; they could not compete
with the porcelain manufactories of France and Germany, so they were
compelled to abandon the factory.</p>

<h3>GERMANY</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">Dresden.</span> The celebrated porcelain manufactory at Dresden, or rather at
Meissen (in its vicinity), was established by Augustus II., Elector of
Saxony, for the manufacture of true porcelain, that is, hard paste. The
experiments of Tschirnhaus and B&ouml;ttcher commenced about 1706, and to the
latter is attributed the invention of hard paste. His first attempt was
a red ware, like jasper, which was cut and polished by the lapidary, and
ornamented by gilding; it was a fine stoneware, having the opacity,
grain, and toughness of pottery. Later, B&ouml;ttcher succeeded in
discovering the mode of making true porcelain by the accidental
detection of the kaolin necessary for the purpose. In consequence of
this important discovery, Augustus II. established the great manufactory
at Meissen, of which B&ouml;ttcher was appointed Director in 1710, and about
1715 he succeeded in making a fine white porcelain. The first
decorations upon this ware were very imperfect, consisting of a blue
colour under the glaze, in imitation of Nankin blue porcelain. It was
under Horoldt&#8217;s direction, in 1720, that paintings of a superior
character, accompanied by gilding, and medallions of Chinese figures
were introduced, and magnificent services completed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> In 1731, K&auml;ndler,
a sculptor, superintended the modelling of animals, groups, vases, &amp;c.,
while other artists painted birds, insects, and copies of paintings
principally of the Flemish school. The best <ins class="correction" title="original: propuctions">productions</ins> emanated from
the Dresden manufactory from 1731 to 1756.</p>

<p>K&auml;ndler modelled men and animals of the natural size, as well as
peacocks, herons, pelicans, and other birds. Among the pieces produced
about this time by, or under the direction of, K&auml;ndler, at Meissen was
Count Bruhl&#8217;s tailor mounted upon a goat, with all the implements of his
trade about him. This vain man had a great desire that his likeness
should be executed in porcelain at the royal manufactory, and his
request was complied with, but probably not in such a way as to gratify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
his vanity, for not only the tailor but his wife were thus immortalised,
<i>aere perennius</i>, in porcelain. In 1754 Dietrich became Director, and he
was succeeded in 1796 by Marcolini, whose beautiful productions are well
known. Porcelain of his period is always distinguished by a star
underneath crossed swords. In spite of the precautions taken at Meissen
to prevent the secret becoming known&mdash;the penalty being death, or
perpetual imprisonment in the Castle of K&ouml;nigstein&mdash;some workmen escaped to reveal it elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span><span class="smcap">Berlin.</span> This manufactory for <i>Hard Paste</i> was established by Wilhelm
Caspar Wegeli in 1751, in the Neue Friedrichsstrasse. It was carried on
for about ten years, but it never remunerated the originator, and he
abandoned it in 1761, when Gottskowski, a celebrated banker, became the
purchaser, and removed the works to Leipziger Strasse; assisted by his
capital, they were brought to great perfection.</p>

<p>Johann Ernst Gottskowski obtained the secret of porcelain from Ernst
Heinrich Richard, who had been employed by Wegeli. Gottskowski did not
personally manage the manufactory, but placed it under the management of
the Commissioner Grunenger, which led to his employment from the year
1763 to 1786 as the head of the royal porcelain manufactory at Berlin.</p>

<p>In 1763, Gottskowski gave up to the king the whole of his factory of
porcelain, receiving 225,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> dollars, and entering into a contract for
the sale of his secrets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With a view to encouraging the manufacture in his kingdom, the king made
presents of superb services of Berlin china to several German princes in
the year 1766. When Frederick the Great occupied Dresden, in the seven
years&#8217; war, he expatriated many of the best modellers and painters to
form his royal manufactory; among these were Meyer, Klipsel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> B&ouml;hme.
The king also transported great quantities of the clay and a portion of
the collection. Independently of this, and the better to insure
employment for the five hundred persons engaged in the processes, he
restricted the Jews resident in any part of his dominions from entering
into the marriage state, until each man had obtained a certificate from
himself, which was only granted on the production of a voucher from the
Director of the manufactory that porcelain to a given amount had been
purchased, and that there was reasonable cause for granting the
indulgence. Of course the Jews more readily disposed of their purchases
than the general dealers, and the device was attended with favourable
results. To insure the success of the establishment and extend its
operations, Frederick embraced every opportunity that was presented; and
it was so well supported that in 1776 seven hundred men were constantly
employed, and it is said that three thousand pieces of porcelain were
made daily.</p>

annually to the amount of 90,000 dollars.</p>

<p>About 1872, the Berlin Royal Porcelain Manufactory was working seven
kilns, and employing three hundred workmen; the annual produce amounted
on an average to half a million finished articles, value 150,000

succeeded Herr Frick in the direction), under whom were Dr. Eisner as
chemist, Herr Mantel as master modeller, and Herr Looschen as head

J. F. Clarus, two merchants of Frankfort, assisted by A. von L&ouml;wenfinck,
but they were unsuccessful, and called in Ringler, of Vienna, who had
escaped from the manufactory. During the Electorate of Johann Friedrich
Karl, Archbishop of Mainz, their porcelain ranked among the first in
Europe. About 1760 the celebrated modeller Melchior was engaged, and
some very elegant statuettes and designs for vases, &amp;c., were produced.
Melchior left the manufactory about 1785, and his successor, Ries, was
not so skilful, and all his figures having disproportionate heads, the
so-called &#8220;thick-head&#8221; period commenced. Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> Gottlieb Kuntze was

1747, by a potter named Niedermayer. Graf von Hainshausen became its
patron in 1754, and in 1756 he sent for Ringler, who organised the
establishment, and it was then placed under the protection of the
Elector Maximilian Joseph. On the death of his successor, Carl Theodore,
in 1799, the Frankenthal manufactory was abandoned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> and transferred to
Nymphenburg, which is still a royal establishment, and well supported.
The pieces are manufactured in white at Nymphenburg, but chiefly
decorated at Munich and elsewhere; that is the reason why on the same
piece the Nymphenburg mark is frequently found impressed, with the mark
of some other factory painted in colour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thuringia.</span> In the middle of the 18th century a number of small porcelain
factories sprang up in this district. It is said that they owe their
origin to a chemist named Macheleid, who discovered by accident a

it was farmed by a merchant named Nonne, of Erfurt, who greatly enlarged
and improved the works. About the year 1770 it was carried on by
Greiner. In 1795 more than 120 workmen were employed.</p>

<h3>AUSTRIA</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VIENNA</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">This</span> manufactory for <i>hard paste</i> was founded about 1717. There are
several traditions as to its origin: one is that a musician named La
France, and a billiard-marker, named Dupuis, brought with them to
Vienna, in October 1717, a certain Cristofle Conrad H&uuml;nger, who had been
employed at Meissen as an enamel painter and gilder, and that in the
following year they were joined by a man named St&ouml;lzel of Meissen, who
was possessed of the secret, and became director. Another that it was a
private enterprise set on foot by Claude du Pasquier, who obtained from
the Emperor Charles VII. a privilege for twenty-five years. Major Byng
Hall (<i>Adventures of a Bric-&agrave;-Brac Hunter</i>), however, says that it was
established in 1718 by Claude Innocenz de Blaquier, who engaged one
Stenzel or St&ouml;lzel to co-operate with him. With this object in view De
Blaquier proceeded secretly to Meissen, where he contrived to scrape
acquaintance with the arcanist in a coffee-house. He engaged with
Stenzel in a game of billiards, taking care to lose, and thus he secured
his object. Stenzel after some slight hesitation, accepted an offer of a
thousand dollars to be paid yearly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i183.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 166.&mdash;Cabaret.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>De Blaquier had to contend with many difficulties owing to his not being
possessed of the secret, and at the end of the second year Stenzel not
having been paid regularly according to his contract, returned to
Meissen, after having maliciously destroyed many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> the models. The
works had consequently to be suspended. But De Blaquier, being a man of
energy and determination, endeavoured by numerous experiments to
discover the porcelain mixture, and his efforts were finally crowned
with success.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i184.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 167.&mdash;Milk-pot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After twenty-five years&#8217; labour De Blaquier decided in 1744 to offer the
works to the Government.</p>

<p>The young Empress Maria Theresa resolved to support the factory, which
promised to give occupation and profit to her subjects, honour and gain
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> the State. She therefore commanded that it should be taken by State
contract from its owner, and that De Blaquier should receive the
direction with a salary of 1500 florins a year.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i185.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 168.&mdash;Plate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>From 1747 to 1790 was the best period for figures and groups, while from
1780 to 1820 painting on china became celebrated, the subjects being
taken from paintings by Watteau, Lancret, Boucher, Angelica Kauffmann,
and others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>In 1785 the most important improvements were made under the Baron de
Lorgenthal or Sorgenthal; artists of the highest talents were employed,
a first-rate chemist named Leithner was engaged to prepare the colours
and gilding, the <i>chefs d&#8217;&oelig;uvre</i> of the early masters were copied,
while the gilding was brought to a perfection which has never been
surpassed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the death of the Baron in 1805, Neidermayer became Director. The
manufacture continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> in its flourishing condition until about 1815.
From the year 1784 to the date of its extinction, it was the custom to
mark every piece with the number of the year, which circumstance may be
of great service to the connoisseur who seeks early specimens of Vienna
porcelain. It is stamped without colour underneath the piece&mdash;or rather
indented, the first numeral being omitted; thus the number 792 stands
for 1792; 802 for 1802; and so on.</p>

<p>From 1827, under the direction of Scholtz, who followed Niedermayer, the
manufactory began to decline, and what with economy, indifferent
workmen, and bad artists copying from French models its doom was sealed.
It gradually dwindled down to a second-rate factory, and in consequence
of the great annual expense it was discontinued in 1864. The books on
art belonging to the factory, and all the drawings of its most
successful period, together with many of the models, the library, and
the keramic collection, were given to the Imperial Museum in Vienna, to
be retained as a lasting memorial of its celebrity.</p>

the composition of hard paste. After existing seven years, the factory
was closed in 1771. Notwithstanding the unsuccessful result from a
commercial point of view, it was reopened by a Protestant minister, the
Rev. De Moll, of Oude Loosdrecht, associated with some capitalists of
Amsterdam, but the next year it was removed to Loosdrecht. The
decorations are very much of the Saxon character.</p>

but it gradually declined, in consequence of the large importations from
England which inundated the country. In 1789 it came into the hands of
J. Rendorp, C. Van der Hoop, and Gysbz, still remaining under D&auml;uber&#8217;s

<h3>FRANCE</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">St. Cloud.</span> A factory was established here about 1695 for the production
of porcelain, at which time M. Morin was proprietor, and M. Chicanneau
director of the works.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i209.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 198.&mdash;Jug.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>According to letters patent of 1702, granted to the heirs of Chicanneau,
his widow, Barbe Courdray, and her children, were interested in the
works; their father had made many experiments and attempts to discover
the secret of true porcelain, and from the year 1696 had produced some
nearly equal to the porcelain of China. His children, to whom he
imparted the secret, successfully continued the fabrication, and were
permitted to manufacture porcelain at St. Cloud, or in any other part or
parts of the kingdom, except Rouen and its faubourgs. In 1712 a renewal
of the patent took place for ten years, and in the meantime the widow
Barbe Courdray married a M. Trou.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i210.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 199.&mdash;Statuette.</span><br /><i>Astronomy seated, holding the sun.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1722 letters patent were granted for twenty years more to Jean and
Jean Baptiste Chicanneau, Marie Moreau, the widow of Pierre Chicanneau
(third son) and Henri and Gabriel Trou, children of Barbe Courdray by
her second marriage. About this time serious disagreements occurred
between the two families, and they separated, Gabriel and Henri Trou
remaining at St. Cloud, patronised by the Duke of Orleans; while Marie
Moreau opened another establishment in the Rue de la Ville l&#8217;&Eacute;v&ecirc;que,
Faubourg St. Honor&eacute;, directed by Dominique Fran&ccedil;ois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> Chicanneau. In 1742
another <i>arr&ecirc;t</i> granted privileges for twenty years to both these
establishments, and Marie Moreau dying in 1743 left Dominique her
business.</p>

<p>The manufactory at St. Cloud was destroyed by fire (the act of an
incendiary) in 1773, and the manufacture ceased, the proprietors not
being able to raise sufficient funds to rebuild it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chantilly.</span> This manufactory was founded in 1725 by Ciquaire Cirou, under
the patronage of the Prince de Cond&eacute;, as appears by letters patent dated
1735, who was succeeded by Antheaume and others. The porcelain was
highly esteemed, and there was hardly any object which they did not
produce, from the lofty vase to the simplest knife handle. The Chantilly
pattern was a great favourite for ordinary services; it was called
&#8220;Barbeau,&#8221; and consisted of a small blue flower running over the white
paste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rouen.</span> Louis Poterat, Sieur de St. &Egrave;tienne, of St. Sever, at Rouen,
obtained letters patent in 1673,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> stating that he had discovered
processes for fabricating porcelain similar to that of China, and wares
resembling those of Delft; but the former was of a very rude character
and never arrived at any perfection.</p>

<p>After the establishment at St. Cloud had commenced selling porcelain,
the proprietors of the Rouen manufactory appear to have revived their
porcelain in the hopes of competing with them, but with no good result.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mennecy-Villeroy.</span> This important manufactory was established in 1735 by
Fran&ccedil;ois Barbin, under the patronage of the Duc de Villeroy. The early

<p>After the decapitation of the unfortunate de Custine, his estates, being
forfeited to the Republic, were sold on the 25 Germinal, An X (1802), to
M. Lanfray, and carried on by him until his death in 1827, when the
manufactory was sold to L. G. Dryander, of Saarbr&uuml;cken. For many years
he continued to make porcelain, as well as fayence groups and
statuettes, but the distance of his <i>fabrique</i> from the kaolin of St.
Yrieix prevented him from competing successfully with those of Limoges,
and this branch was abandoned.</p>

<h3>VINCENNES AND S&Egrave;VRES</h3>

<p>The history of the celebrated manufactory at S&egrave;vres must be traced back
to that of St. Cloud, which was founded as early as 1695. Here Louis
XIV. accorded his patronage and favour by granting exclusive privileges.
In 1735 the secret of the manufacture was carried, by some of the
workmen, to Chantilly, and for a time continued there by the brothers
Dubois. They left in a few years, taking with them their secret, and
settled at Vincennes, where a laboratory was granted them, but after
three years they were dismissed.</p>

<p>In 1745, a sculptor, named Charles Adam, formed a company, and the
scheme was approved of by the king, privileges being accorded them for
thirty years, and a place granted for their works in the Ch&acirc;teau de
Vincennes. In 1753 the privileges of Charles Adam were purchased by Eloy
Brichard, and Louis XV. took a third share; hence the factory became a
royal establishment. Madame de Pompadour considerably encouraged the
ceramic art, and it arrived at the height of perfection. The buildings
were found too small to meet the increasing demands for the beautiful
productions, and in 1756 the works were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> removed to a large edifice at
S&Egrave;VRES built expressly for the company.</p>

<p>A favourite decoration of Vincennes porcelain was flowers and birds, on
a beautiful <i>bleu de roi</i> ground, and cupids painted in <i>cama&iuml;eu</i> of a
single colour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1760 the king became sole proprietor, and M. Boileau was appointed
director.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>In 1769, after Macquer had brought the making of hard paste to
perfection, the manufacture was successfully established at S&egrave;vres, and
both descriptions of china continued to be made until 1804, when,
Brongniart being director, soft paste was altogether discontinued, and
declared to be &#8220;useless in art, of expensive manipulation, dangerous to
the workmen, subject to great risk in the furnace, &amp;c.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The principal colours used in decorating the ground of the S&egrave;vres vases
were:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <i>bleu c&eacute;leste</i>, or turquoise, invented in 1752 by Hellot.</p>

<p>2. The rich cobalt blue, called <i>bleu de roi</i>, of which there were two
varieties, the darker being designated <i>gros bleu</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>3. The <i>violet pens&eacute;e</i>, a beautiful violet from a mixture of manganese,
one of the rarest decorations of the <i>p&acirc;te tendre</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 231.&mdash;Vase.</span></p>

<p>4. The <i>rose Pompadour</i> (called in England <i>rose Du-Barry</i>), a charming
pink or rose colour invented in 1757 by Xhrouet of S&egrave;vres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>5. The clear yellow or <i>jonquille</i>, a sort of canary colour.</p>

<p>6. The <i>vert pr&eacute;</i>, or bright grass green.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i235.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 232.&mdash;&Eacute;cuelle.</span><br /><i>Dated 1771.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. The <i>vert pomme</i>, or apple green.</p>

<p>8. The <i>rouge de fer</i>, a brilliant red.</p>

<p>9. The <i>&oelig;il de perdrix</i> was at a later period a favourite ornament
for the grounds of vases.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>The forms are exceedingly varied, but names are assigned to each, either
from the designers of the models or their special shapes or
ornamentation; these may be found at length in <i>Marks and Monograms on
Pottery and Porcelain</i>, 10th edition.</p>

<p>The beautiful <i>p&acirc;te tendre</i> ware of S&egrave;vres was always much esteemed, and
never could have been produced at a reasonable price even at the time it
was made, the expense of decoration as well as the risk in firing being
so great. It was manufactured for royal presents or occasionally sold by
express permission at exorbitant prices, which bore a more approximate
value to the present exorbitant prices than is generally supposed.</p>

<h2>GREAT BRITAIN</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>POTTERY</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">The</span> earthenware vessels made in England previous to the 16th century
were of a very coarse description, rudely fashioned and usually devoid
of ornament, sometimes cast in a mould in grotesque forms, and
occasionally covered with a yellow or green glaze. Numerous specimens of
early English cups are found in excavations in London and other parts of
England, and may be identified by comparison with the vessels in Norman
and medi&aelig;val manuscripts.</p>

<p>Although inexpensive, they were badly burned, and not very durable; and
the German stoneware with a salt glaze was eagerly sought after
throughout the 16th century, and imported in large quantities. These
stone pots were usually impressed with the arms of German towns; a rose
or other device in front, and a ferocious bearded visage under the
spout. They were derisively called bellarmines, after the celebrated
Cardinal Bellarmin, who in the 16th century made himself so conspicuous
by his zealous opposition to the Reformed religion.</p>

<p>These bellarmines were in general use throughout England in the 16th and
beginning of the 17th century at inns and public-houses for serving ale
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> the customers. The importation of these stone pots was always
monopolised by the potters of Cologne, near which city they were made.
In the reign of Queen Elizabeth we find one William Simpson presenting a
memorial that he may be allowed to bring &#8220;the drinking stone pottes made
at Culloin&#8221; into this country, and requesting permission to make similar
stone pots in England; but he was not successful in his suit.</p>

<p>In 1626, however, two other potters, named Rous and Cullyn, merchants of
the city of London, obtained the exclusive privilege of making stone
pots and jugs in this country, and a patent was granted them for
fourteen years; the preamble states that &#8220;heretofore, and at this
present, our kingdom of England has been served with stone pottes, stone
jugges, and stone bottells, out of foreign parts, from beyond the seas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>STAFFORDSHIRE</h3>

<p>When Dr. Plot wrote his natural history of this county in 1686 there
were very few manufactories of pottery; he only speaks of one at
Amblecott and another at Wednesbury; but he says: &#8220;The greatest pottery
they have in this country is carried on at Burslem, near
Newcastle-under-Lyme.&#8221; The earthenware made here towards the end of the
17th century was of a very coarse character, and the decoration
extremely rude, consisting merely of patterns trailed over the surface
in coloured clay, technically termed <i>slip</i>, diluted to the consistence
of syrup, so that it could run out through a quill. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> usual colours
of these slips were orange, white, and red, the orange forming the
ground and the white and red the paint. After the dishes had been thus
ornamented they were glazed with lead ore beaten into dust, finely
sifted, and strewed over the surface, which gave it the gloss but not
the colour. The vessels remained twenty-four hours in the kiln, and
were then drawn for sale, principally to poor cratemen, who hawked them
at their backs all over the country.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The forms of these vessels were tygs or mugs, with two or more handles
for passing round a table, candlesticks, dishes, &amp;c. The earliest names
found upon them are Thomas and Ralph Toft, William Talor, Joseph Glass;
all names still known in Staffordshire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span><span class="smcap">Burslem.</span> The family of <span class="smcap">Wedgwood</span> was of long standing at Burslem, and
many members of it were employed in making pottery long before the birth
of the great potter, Josiah Wedgwood. His father, grandfather, and
great-grandfather, as well as many of his other relations, were all
engaged in the trade. Josiah Wedgwood was born in 1730, at Burslem; he
was the youngest of thirteen children; his father, Thomas Wedgwood, died
when Josiah was only nine years old. His eldest brother, Thomas,
succeeded his father as a potter, and Josiah was bound apprentice to him
in 1744, after the expiration of which he left his brother&#8217;s house to
make knife handles, imitation agate, and tortoiseshell small wares, at
Stoke. Here, in 1752, he entered into partnership with John Harrison,
which only lasted two years.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i242.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 237.&mdash;Vase.</span><br /><i>Pale blue jasper, with subjects in relief.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next Josiah Wedgwood went into partnership with Thomas Whieldon of
Fenton Low, one of the most eminent potters of his day, and they
remained <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>together five years; while here Wedgwood also produced that
fine green glaze which covered his dessert services, in imitation of
leaves.</p>

<p>At the expiration of the partnership in 1759 Wedgwood returned to
Burslem, and commenced business on his own account at the &#8220;Churchyard&#8221;
works. He soon became so successful that he was compelled to enlarge his
establishment, and to take over the &#8220;Ivy House&#8221; works. He engaged the
services of his cousin, Thomas Wedgwood, who had gained his experience
at the Worcester works, and in 1765 he took him into partnership, and
three years later Thomas Bentley joined the firm. The first ware which
gained him reputation was his fine cream-coloured ware, which remained a
staple article from 1762 down to the time of his decease, and after
royalty had approved of it the name was changed to Queen&#8217;s ware.</p>

<p>Wedgwood also produced, about this date, a sort of red ware, formed of
the same ochreous clay as was used by the Elers nearly a century before;
it required no glaze except what it derived from friction on the wheel
and lathe, and was covered with engine-turned ornament; and in 1766 he
began to make a black ware, which he called basaltes or black Egyptian.
The business increased so much that he was obliged to open a new
manufactory at <span class="smcap">Etruria</span> in 1769.</p>

<p>In 1773 he made &#8220;a fine white terra-cotta of great beauty and delicacy,
suitable for cameos, portraits, and bas-reliefs&#8221;; this was the
forerunner of the jasper ware, which became by constant attention and
successive improvements the most beautiful of all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> wares. In 1776
the solid jasper ware was invented, which, however, attained its
greatest perfection ten years later. In the manufacture of this elegant
ware Wedgwood largely employed sulphate of barytes, and for many years
derived great profits, none of the workmen having any idea of the nature
of the material upon which they were operating, until a letter
containing a bill of parcels referring to a quantity of the article fell
into the hands of a dishonest servant, who told the secret, and
deprived the inventor of that particular source of emolument: for when
the same article was made by those who employed inferior workmen, to
whom they only paid one-fourth of the salary given by Wedgwood, the
price of jasper ware became so reduced that he was unable to employ
those exquisite modellers whom he had formerly engaged to superintend
that branch of the manufacture.</p>

<p>In 1785 a &#8220;jasper dip&#8221; was introduced, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> the white clay vessels
were dipped, and received a coating of jasper, instead of being jasper
throughout. This was considered a great improvement, and caused an
increase of 20 per cent. in the price.</p>

<p>Flaxman was engaged by Wedgwood and Bentley as early as 1775, and he
furnished them with drawings and models. After Bentley&#8217;s death in 1780
Flaxman&#8217;s fame as a sculptor obtained him more important work, but
still, as time permitted, he worked for Wedgwood up to the time of his

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>In 1773 <span class="smcap">Ralph Shawe</span> of Burslem took out a patent for chocolate-coloured
ware, striped with white and lined with white, glazed with salt. He
afterwards transferred his factory to France.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph Wood</span> was established at Burslem about 1730, and was succeeded
about 1750 by his son <span class="smcap">Aaron Wood</span>, who served his apprenticeship to
Thos. Wedgwood; he was a very clever cutter of moulds for stoneware
plates and dishes, with raised pattern borders, &amp;c., which have been
erroneously termed Elizabethan. Cream ware is said to have been invented
by him. He was succeeded, about 1770, by his son <span class="smcap">Enoch Wood</span>, who was
also a sculptor, and made many busts of eminent men. His successors were
Wood and Caldwell, who continued the manufacture of busts and groups.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shelton. Astbury</span> of Shelton, early in the 18th century, made red crouch,
and white stoneware. It is said he derived his knowledge of mixing the
clays by pretending to be an idiot and obtaining employment at the
Elers&#8217; manufactory at Bradwell;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> after gaining their secret, he set up
in business against them.</p>

<p>The first use of calcined flints as an ingredient in the composition of
pottery is attributed to the younger Astbury; it led to the manufacture
of fine fayence, and paved the way for the great improvements afterwards
achieved by Wedgwood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samuel Hollins</span> of Shelton established about 1760 a manufactory of fine
red ware teapots; he procured the clay from Bradwell. He was succeeded
about 1777 by T. and <span class="smcap">J. Hollins</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>The <span class="smcap">New Hall China Works</span> at Shelton owed their origin to the purchase of
Champion&#8217;s (Cookworthy&#8217;s) patent by a company of potters in 1777, and
were the first porcelain manufactory in Staffordshire. The ware made
here was not of a fine character; inferior artists were employed in its
production, and it was never held in any great esteem. The manufacture
consequently soon fell to decay, after many changes. The mark is the
name of the works in a double ring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bradwell.</span> A potter to whom Staffordshire was indebted for great
improvements in the ware was <span class="smcap">John Philip Elers</span>, who about 1690 came over
from Holland and settled at Bradwell. He was descended from a noble
family of Saxony.</p>

<p>Elers was a clever chemist, and discovered the art of mixing the clays
of Staffordshire to greater perfection than had ever before been
attained. He manufactured to a considerable extent an improved kind of
red pottery, in imitation of that of Japan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> while by the addition of
manganese to the clays, he made a fine black ware, which a century
afterwards was adopted and improved by Wedgwood.</p>

the brown stoneware about 1700. There is in the Victoria and Albert
Museum a fayence barrel of brown glaze with gilt hoops, dating
apparently from the first half of the 18th century, and it is impressed
with the name of Miles (see Fig. 251).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elijah Mayer</span> of Hanley was a contemporary of Wedgwood. He was noted for
his cream-coloured ware and brown-line ware, but he produced many other
varieties. A vase of unglazed drab terra-cotta, with festoons, &amp;c., in
relief, coloured (see Fig. 252).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span><span class="smcap">Palmer</span> of Hanley was a great pirate of Wedgwood&#8217;s inventions, and Mrs.
Palmer, who seems to have been the active manager of her husband&#8217;s
business, engaged persons surreptitiously to obtain Wedgwood and
Bentley&#8217;s new patterns as soon as they arrived at the London warehouse,
for the purpose of copying them. Palmer had a London partner of the name
of <span class="smcap">Neale</span>. They imitated Wedgwood&#8217;s black Egyptian vases and other
inventions, and eventually his Etruscan painted vases. In 1776 Palmer
failed, and the business was carried on by Neale &amp; Co., who by some
means discovered the secret of the jasper body. They became formidable
rivals of Wedgwood.</p>

the common household articles, he made fancy marbled ware. Aaron Wood
and Josiah Spode were his apprentices, and Josiah Wedgwood was in
partnership with him until 1759.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tunstall. Enoch Booth</span> of Tunstall, and <span class="smcap">John Warburton</span> of <span class="smcap">Cobridge</span> in the
same county, were extensive potters, and first made cream-coloured
pottery by the use of fluid glaze introduced by Booth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Adams</span> of Tunstall was a favourite pupil of Wedgwood, and while
with him executed some of his finest specimens of jasper ware. He
afterwards went into business on his own account, and carried on an
extensive trade.</p>

Stoke-upon-Trent in 1791; he was apprenticed to Turner of Caughley as an
engraver. His productions were of the useful kind, viz., services for
the table, in imitation of common nankin. He died in 1836, and was
succeeded by his second son, the celebrated Herbert Minton, who brought
the potter&#8217;s art to great perfection. He largely increased the business,
and manufactured articles in earthenware, hard and soft porcelain, and
parian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> Reproductions of Italian maiolica, Delia Robbia, Palissy, and
Henri II. ware were also extensively made by him. He died in 1858, and
was succeeded by Michael Daintry Hollins and Colin Minton Campbell, his
nephew and heir. The founder&#8217;s grandsons afterwards succeeded to the

<p><span class="smcap">Liverpool.</span> Early in the 18th century, and probably much before that,
Liverpool was noted for the manufacture of pottery. Little is known of
its early history, and it was not until Mr. Jos. Mayer rescued from
oblivion many interesting particulars that anything like a succinct
account was published. In his interesting notice of the Art of Pottery
in Liverpool, we learn that the most celebrated of the early potters was
Alderman Thomas Shaw, who had works for making pottery in the beginning
of the 18th century; several large plaques and monumental slabs of his
make are in existence, dated from 1716 to 1756. About this time, there
seems to have been a large demand for punch bowls; as these formed the
principal ornaments on the sideboards of the middle classes, and
especially on board the ships, which were constantly going and coming in
the port, considerable pains were taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> in decorating them, and many
are still in existence painted with ships, convivial mottoes, and
inscriptions.</p>

<p>Another important establishment was founded by Mr. John Sadler, the son
of a painter, who had learnt the art of engraving.</p>

<p>He was the inventor, about 1752, of the method of transferring prints
from engraved copper plates upon pottery, and in conjunction with Guy
Green, proposed to take out a patent in 1756, the draft of which is
still preserved, but they preferred keeping the invention secret to the
doubtful security of patent rights.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i260.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 262.&mdash;Punch Bowl.</span></p>

<p>Wedgwood availed himself of this new mode of decoration, and sent his
Queen&#8217;s ware weekly to Messrs. Sadler and Green to be printed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span><span class="smcap">Richard Chaffers</span> was the principal manufacturer of Liverpool; he served
his apprenticeship with Alderman Shaw, and in 1752 established a bank
for the manufacture of blue and white earthenware and fine porcelain,
which gained him great reputation; they were largely exported to our
American Colonies (now the United States).</p>

<p>His porcelain works were established about the same time as those of
Worcester and Derby, and his productions had a great sale in England.</p>

<p>The Liverpool establishments of <span class="smcap">Pennington, Philip Christian</span> and <span class="smcap">Richard
Abbey</span> were on an extensive scale, but towards the end of the eighteenth
century only one of any importance survived, and that belonged to
Messrs. <span class="smcap">Worthington</span>, <span class="smcap">Humble</span> and <span class="smcap">Holland</span>, who in 1796 established a large
manufactory on the south bank of the Mersey. As Wedgwood had christened
his settlement Etruria they called theirs Herculaneum. A larger capital
being required, in 1806 an increase of proprietors took place. The first
wares made here were Queen&#8217;s and blue printed ware. About 1800 the
production of porcelain was commenced, the mark used being
&#8220;Herculaneum,&#8221; or &#8220;Herculaneum Pottery.&#8221; About 1836, when the factory
came into possession of Messrs. Case, Mort &amp; Co., the mark used was a
bird called the liver, which forms the crest of the Borough of
Liverpool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jackfield</span>, near Thursfield, in Shropshire. There was an old pottery here
about 1760. The ware was of a red clay, with a brilliant black glaze,
sometimes with scrolls and flowers in relief. Tea services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> are
frequently seen. The jugs were known in the locality as &#8220;black
decanters.&#8221; About 1780 the works were taken by Mr. John Rose, and
subsequently removed to <span class="smcap">Coalport</span>, on the opposite side of the Severn,
where the well-known Salopian porcelain was made.</p>

<p>Fig. 265. A black glazed teapot inscribed &#8220;Richard and Ruth Goodin,

<p><span class="smcap">Fulham.</span> The first successful imitation of the <i>gr&egrave;s de Cologne</i> was made
by <span class="smcap">John Dwight</span>, an Oxfordshire gentleman, and in course of time it
almost entirely superseded the importation from abroad. This great
potter took out his first patent in 1671, and probably established a
manufactory at Fulham in that year, which was successfully carried on
through two patents of fourteen years each. The Fulham stoneware is of
exceedingly hard and close texture, very compact and sonorous, covered
with a salt glaze, of grey colour, ornamented with a brilliant blue
enamel in bands, leaves, and flowers, having medallions of kings and
queens of England in front, with Latin names and titles, or their
initials only.</p>

<p>Dwight produced a great variety of objects, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> brought the potter&#8217;s
art to a great perfection. The figures, busts, and groups are
exquisitely modelled, and will bear comparison with any contemporary
manufactures of Europe. A careful inspection will convince any
unprejudiced mind of the erroneous impression which exists, that until
the time of Wedgwood the potter&#8217;s art in England was at a very low ebb,
and that none but the rudest description of pottery was made, without
any attempt to display artistic excellence. For here, a century before
Josiah Wedgwood&#8217;s time, we have examples of English pottery which would
do credit to the atelier of that distinguished potter himself. John
Dwight died in the year 1737, and with him also departed the glory of
his manufactory at Fulham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span><span class="smcap">Lambeth.</span> The next important pottery in England in the 17th century was
that of Lambeth. In the <i>History of Lambeth</i> it is related that about
1650 some Dutch potters established themselves here, and by degrees the
industry became important, for the village contained no less than twenty
manufactories, in which were made the glazed pottery and tiles used in
London and various parts of England. The ware was very much of the
character of Delft, with a fine white creamy glaze, painted with
landscapes and figures in blue.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i265.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>The white bottles or jugs, upon which are written the names of wines
accompanied by dates, were made here.</p>

<p>The trade flourished here for more than a century, until about 1780 or
1790, at which time the Staffordshire potters, by the great improvements
they had made in the quality of their ware, and having coal and clay
ready to their hand, were enabled to produce it at a cheaper rate, and
eventually beat the Lambeth potters out of the field.</p>

<p>The Lambeth potters, about the end of the 17th century, appear also to
have copied the forms of the Palissy ware, especially in large oval
dishes with initials and dates. Fig. 267 is an example of one of these
dishes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yearsley</span>, in Yorkshire. A pottery of coarse character was made here in
the 17th century. A factory was established by an ancestor of Josiah
Wedgwood about the year 1700; and on the estate of Sir George Wombwell
fragments of pottery, of a coarse brown ware, with lead glaze, have been
frequently found on the site of the old manufactory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>There was also a manufactory established at the Manor-house, <span class="smcap">York</span>, about
1665, of which little is known except the mention of its existence by
Ralph Thoresby and Horace Walpole; although it is by the former
erroneously called porcelain, the ware was actually a fine stoneware,
with a salt glaze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Pottery.</span> There was a pottery on the river Don, near Doncaster,
established by Mr. John Green of New-hill, who came from the Leeds
pottery about 1790. In 1807 some other members of his family joined the
firm, and it was for a short time &#8220;Greens, Clark, &amp; Co.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Don Pottery was very similar to that of Leeds, frequently producing
pierced work-baskets, vases, dinner, dessert and tea services, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leeds.</span> This ware was made by Messrs. Hartley, Greens, &amp; Co. in 1770. It
is of a sort of cream colour, and has much perforated or basket-work,
sharply cut out of the borders in various patterns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> Important
centre-pieces with figures were also made here.</p>

Queen&#8217;s ware and the black Egyptian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span><span class="smcap">Swinton</span>, near Rotherham. Initiated by Edward Butler in 1757, on the
estate of the Marquis of Rockingham. In 1765 it was carried on by
William Malpas, and in 1778 by Messrs. Bingley, Brameld, &amp; Co., who
enlarged the works, and made earthenware of a very superior quality.
Rockingham teapots, of a mottled chocolate colour, glazed inside with
white, were in great repute. But the aims of the Messrs. Brameld were of
a higher character, and some works of artistic merit were produced. When
the Rockingham works were closed in 1842 many of the moulds were
purchased by Mr. John Reed, and transferred to the Mexborough pottery.</p>

with transfer engravings. On the inside was usually a toad in relief.</p>

<h2>GREAT BRITAIN</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PORCELAIN</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">The</span> manufacture of porcelain in England began much earlier than has been
generally supposed, and the invention was patented in England by John
Dwight of Fulham in 1671, while that at St. Cloud was not patented until
1702, thirty years afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worcester.</span> Although this manufactory originated more than a century and
a half ago, and has always been carried on by private enterprise, it is
still in a flourishing state. It was established in 1751, chiefly
through the exertions of Dr. Wall, a physician and a good practical
chemist, who in conjunction with others formed the &#8220;Worcester Porcelain
Company.&#8221; The early productions were principally of the useful
description, and were sold at a cheaper rate than the wares of Bow and
Chelsea. About the year 1757, the important method of multiplying
designs upon the biscuit ware by means of transferring impressions of
engraved copper plates to the surface, was adopted at Worcester almost
at the same time as at Liverpool, the invention being in fact claimed by
both; but specimens are found bearing the names of Sadler and Green of
Liverpool, and Richard Holdship and Robert Hancock of Worcester, dated
in the same year. Bat printing succeeded the printing from engraved or
etched plates. This new style was accomplished thus: instead of the
design being first printed upon paper and then transferred, the plate
was stippled with a fine point by London artists after designs of
landscapes, shells, fruit, and flowers by Cipriani, Bartolozzi, Cosway,
and Angelica Kauffmann, who were so fashionable about the end of the
18th century. The copper plate being carefully cleaned, a thin coating
of linseed oil was laid upon it, and removed by the palm of the hand
from the surface, leaving the oil in the engraved spots; instead of
paper, bats of glue were used, cut into squares of the size of the
engraving; one of these bats was pressed on to the plate, so as to
receive the oil out of the engraved holes, and laid on to the china,
transferring the oil to the surface; it was then dusted with the colour
required, the superfluous colour being removed carefully with cotton
wool, and the china was then placed in the kiln.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i278.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>In 1783 the Worcester porcelain works were purchased by Mr. Thomas
Flight, from whom they afterwards passed to Messrs. Flight and Barr; the
principal painters at this time were: J. Pennington, who painted
figures; S. Astles, flowers; G. Davis, exotic birds in the Chelsea
style; Webster, landscapes and flowers; J. Barker, shells; Brewer of
Derby, landscapes; while Thomas Baxter, an accomplished artist, painted
figure subjects.</p>

<p>The Worcester works remained with Messrs. Flight &amp; Barr until 1840, when
the two principal manufactories of Worcester&mdash;that of Flight &amp; Barr, and
that of the Messrs. Chamberlain, were amalgamated; the plant and stock
were removed to the premises of the latter, and the new firm was styled
Chamberlain &amp; Co. The last-named works were established by Robert
Chamberlain in 1786; he was the first apprentice at the Old Worcester
Porcelain Company, and he and his brother Humphrey took premises in High
Street. At first they only decorated porcelain, which they bought of
Turner of Caughley; but they afterwards manufactured largely on their
own account,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> and their business increased to a great extent, being
patronised by the royal family.</p>

<p>These two works which were united in 1840, remained so until 1852, when
Messrs. Kerr &amp; Binns became the ostensible proprietors. In 1862 another
Joint Stock Company was formed, Mr. R. W. Binns having the direction of
the artistic department and Mr. Edward Phillips being general
superintendent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swinton</span>, near Rotherham. The manufacture of porcelain at the
<span class="smcap">Rockingham Works</span> was introduced, under the patronage of the Earl
Fitzwilliam, about the year 1823 by Thomas Brameld, who spared no
expense in endeavouring to bring it to perfection. The china was of a
superior description, and the painting and decoration were of a high
character. In 1832 royal patronage was obtained and a magnificent
service was ordered by King William IV.; instead, however, of placing
the firm in a flourishing condition, it was actually the cause of its
ruin, for the expense incurred by the engagement of first-class artists,
and the super-abundance of gold employed in decorating the service,
resulted in so great a loss that the manufacture was totally
discontinued a few years after.</p>

was carried on at Cock Pit Hill by Messrs. John and Christopher Heath
for pottery and porcelain. It is said to have been on an extensive
scale, but little is known of its operations. The proprietors, who were
bankers in Full Street, became bankrupt in 1780, when the stock was sold
and the works discontinued.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The &#8220;Derby Porcelain Manufactory&#8221; was founded in 1751 by William
Duesbury; the first productions were chimney ornaments, lambs, sheep,
and services for the table, but it was probably not until he purchased
the Chelsea works in 1769 that any great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> reputation was acquired, and
few if any of the early specimens can be identified. Some beautiful
examples of porcelain painted in the Chinese style were produced about
this time, but as the rage for oriental ware seemed so prevalent, the
proprietor, to insure the sale of his china, copied the Chinese marks as
well as the style of decoration. Crown Derby was produced from 1780, and
was continued by Bloor, the successor of Duesbury, as late as 1830.
After the purchase of the Chelsea and Bow works, the Derby porcelain
manufactory rose to great importance, the proprietors having of course
retained the best workmen who had been engaged there. In fact, with all
the models and moulds, the mixers, throwers, and painters of those two
great establishments, the manufactory may be considered as the Chelsea
and Bow works continued in another locality. Upon the death of William
Duesbury, in 1785, his son William continued the business, and a third
William Duesbury succeeded in the beginning of the last century. About
1815, Robert Bloor took over the works, which were altogether closed in
1848. An offshoot, however, is still carried on.</p>

partnership with John Coke; the former was a practical potter, having
been engaged at the Derby works as a flower painter, in which capacity
he excelled; he brought with him a staff of workmen and their families,
and the factory went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> on successfully for about five or six years, when
Billingsley left; it was continued by Coke, and afterwards by Cutts the
foreman, but was altogether discontinued about 1812. The ware made here
by Billingsley was of a peculiar transparent character; and a favourite
pattern was the French sprig or &#8220;Chantilly,&#8221; being an imitation of the
Angoul&ecirc;me china.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lowestoft.</span> According to Gillingham&#8217;s <i>History of Lowestoft</i>, written in
1790, an attempt was made to manufacture porcelain there in 1756 by Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
Hewlin Luson of Gunton Hall, he having found some fine clay on his
estate suitable for the purpose, and in the following year Messrs.
Gillingwater, Walker, Browne, Aldred, and Richman, established the
Lowestoft porcelain works, which existed until 1802. The porcelain was
of soft paste, and in 1902 fragments of it and moulds were found on the
site of the factory. The theory that hard paste was made at Lowestoft or
that Chinese porcelain was painted there has now been abandoned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plymouth.</span> About the year 1755 William Cookworthy commenced his
experiments to ascertain the nature of true porcelain of hard paste,
and searched with great perseverance throughout England for the
materials which were the constituent parts of Chinese porcelain. At
length a friend of his discovered on the estate of Lord Camelford, in
the parish of St. Stephen&#8217;s, Cornwall, &#8220;a certain white saponaceous
clay, and close by it a species of granite or moorstone, white with
greenish spots, which he immediately perceived to be the two long
sought-for ingredients, the one giving whiteness and body to the paste,
the other vitrification and transparency.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>The patent was obtained in 1768, and the materials were described as
growan stone and growan clay. The works were carried on for nearly six
years, and consequently a considerable quantity of ware was made.
Cookworthy engaged the services of a French artist, M. Soqui, whose
ornamental delineations on the articles produced here were very
beautiful. Some elegant salt-cellars and table ornaments in the form of
open conch shells resting on a bed of coral, &amp;c., all well modelled in
hard paste, were favourites for the table.</p>

<p>Cookworthy and Lord Camelford continued to work this manufactory until

Champion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span><span class="smcap">Bristol.</span> A manufactory of <i>soft paste</i> porcelain was founded at Bristol
about 1750. Later Richard Champion, having in 1774 purchased
Cookworthy&#8217;s patent, opened a manufactory for <i>hard paste</i>. The ware was
brought to great perfection, but the large outlay prevented its being
remunerative, and in three or four years he sold his interest in the
patent to a company of Staffordshire potters.</p>

afterwards carried on by a Mr. Gallimore. It was not until 1772 that it
rose to any importance, when Thomas Turner commenced operations. He came
from the Worcester porcelain manufactory; he was an engraver, and
probably learnt his art from Robert Hancock.</p>

<p>The excellence of Turner&#8217;s porcelain gained him great patronage. In 1780
he produced the celebrated &#8220;willow pattern,&#8221; and completed the first
blue printed table service made in England. Thomas Minton of Stoke
assisted in the completion of it, being articled as an engraver at
Caughley.</p>

<p>In 1799 Turner retired and John Rose became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> proprietor; the latter
removed the works to Coalport about 1814 or 1815.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coalport</span>, in Shropshire. The porcelain works here were established about
1780 by John Rose, who had removed his manufactory from Jackfield. He
carried on this and the Caughley works simultaneously. In 1820, both
the Swansea and the Nantgarw manufactories having been purchased, they
were incorporated with Coalport, and Billingsley of Nantgarw was engaged
as mixer of the clays; he remained at Coalport until his death in 1828.
The &#8220;worm sprig&#8221; and the &#8220;Tournay sprig&#8221; were much made at Coalport.</p>

about the middle of the 18th century. Thomas Frye, an eminent painter,
appears to have been instrumental in bringing the china to that
perfection for which the manufactory was celebrated. He took out two
patents for the improvement of porcelain; the first in 1744 was in
conjunction with Edward Heylyn, the second in 1749. In 1750 the works
were disposed of to Messrs. Weatherby &amp; Crowther.</p>

<p>The interesting bowl (now in the British Museum), made at the Bow works
in the year 1760, and painted by Thomas Craft, is accompanied by a short
history of the works, which informs us that the names of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
proprietors were known all over the world, that they employed 300
persons, about 90 painters, and 200 turners, throwers, &amp;c., all under
one roof. (See Fig. 313.) In 1775 or 1776 the works were sold to
Duesbury, and all the moulds and implements were transferred to Derby.</p>

Chaffers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chelsea.</span> This celebrated porcelain manufactory was established about
1740, shortly after that of Bow, and the early productions of the two
are frequently mistaken one for the other; but, fortunately, the Chelsea
wares, especially the finest pieces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> were subsequently marked with an
anchor in gold or red. The period of its greatest excellence was from
1750 to 1765.</p>

<p>The early pieces were copied principally from the Oriental, being
decorated with Chinese patterns, and these were marked with an embossed
anchor.</p>

<p>The beautiful vases in the French style, in imitation of S&egrave;vres, with
<i>gros bleu</i>, crimson, turquoise, and apple-green grounds were made from
1760 to 1765.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>In 1769, by order of M. Sprimont, the proprietor, the Chelsea porcelain

<p>The works were purchased by W. Duesbury of Derby, and carried on by him
at Chelsea until 1784. The later pieces made here under his direction
are easily distinguished; these vessels are of simple elegant forms,
with the frequent recurrence of gold stripes, and the same forms and
style were adopted simultaneously at Derby, but they are inferior to
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> vases made when M. Sprimont had the works under his direction.</p>

<h3>WALES</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Swansea.</span> The manufacture of porcelain was revived at Swansea in 1814 by
L. L. Dillwyn. At that time Billingsley had commenced making his
porcelain at Nantgarw; it naturally attracted Dillwyn&#8217;s attention, and
conceiving that the kilns used by Billingsley &amp; Walker might be
considerably improved, he made arrangements with them to carry on their
process at Swansea. Hence the origin of the Swansea porcelain, which
obtained great repute, and was continued for six or seven years. Baxter,
a clever painter of figure subjects, left Worcester and entered
Dillwyn&#8217;s service in 1816 and continued there for three years, returning
to Worcester in 1819. In the year 1820 the manufactory was discontinued,
and all the moulds and appliances were purchased by John Rose, who
removed them to Coalport about the same time as those of Nantgarw.</p>

painter of Derby, with Walker, after they left Worcester. They produced
some very fine porcelain, of the same peculiar character as that of
Pinxton, with a sort of vitreous appearance and a granulated fracture
like that of lump sugar. Being very soft the paste would not in all
cases stand the heat of the kiln; some of the early pieces are
consequently found cracked on the glaze, or slightly warped and bent.</p>

<h2>ORIENTAL POTTERY AND PORCELAIN</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CHINA</h3>

<p>The porcelain of China is composed of two earths, the one a decomposed
felspathic rock called <i>kaolin</i>, and the other a rock of the same
geological origin, mixed with quartz, called <i>petuntse</i>. They both
harmonise so completely that they have an equally resisting power when
placed in the kiln. The <i>kaolin</i> used in making porcelain is much softer
than <i>petuntse</i> when dug out of the quarry, yet it is this which, by its
mixture with the other, gives strength and firmness to the work.</p>

<p>Chinese porcelain was classified by the late Dr. S. W. Bushell, C.M.G.,
under the following periods:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Primitive period, including the <i>Sung</i> dynasty (960-1279) and the
<i>Yuan</i> dynasty (1280-1367).</p>

<p>2. Ming period, comprising the whole of the <i>Ming</i> dynasty (1368-1643).</p>

<p>3. K&#8217;ang Hsi period, extending from the fall of the Ming dynasty to the
close of the reign of <i>K&#8217;ang Hsi</i> (1662-1722).</p>

<p>4. Yung Ch&ecirc;ng and Chi&ecirc;n Lung period (1723-1795), the two reigns being conjoined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>5. Modern period, from the beginning of the reign of <i>Chia Ch&#8217;ing</i> to
the present day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i308.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 326.&mdash;Stoneware Vase.</span><br /><i>With C&eacute;ladon green glaze.<br />Ming dynasty.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most ancient mode of decoration was the blue <i>cama&iuml;eu</i>, and it is
still much esteemed in China; it was executed on the ware, simply dried
before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> glaze was applied, and then placed in the kiln. Being all
completed in one baking, <i>au grand feu</i>, the painting thus executed
became imperishable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i309.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 327.&mdash;Stoneware Vase.</span><br /><i>With C&eacute;ladon crackle glaze.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is on this blue ware that the greater number of the Chinese
characters are found denoting the period in which the porcelain was
made. The cobalt on the earlier pieces was not so fine as on those of
the <i>Siouen-te</i> and <i>Ching-hoa</i> periods, which are now much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> sought
after. It is extremely difficult to tell even the approximate date of
the coloured pieces, especially as there was a conventional method of
decorating them which had been practised from time immemorial; the
painters worked according to given models or patterns, and monsters,
deities, or flowers and landscapes, of the same uncouth and rude
designs, were placed in successive ages upon the ware.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i310.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 328.&mdash;Porcelain Vase.</span><br /><i>Painted in enamel colours.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The P&egrave;re d&#8217;Entrecolles tells us the manner of painting vases in China,
and how the different parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> of a landscape on one vase were intrusted
to various hands according to their ability to paint special objects
mechanically. He says: &#8220;One is employed solely to form the coloured
circle which is seen round the border of the ware, a second traces the
flowers in outline, which a third fills in with colour; another excels
only in painting the water and the mountains, while the next is only
competent to portray birds or animals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 329.&mdash;Porcelain Ewer.</span><br /><i>Painted in enamel colours,

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>A sort of very hard stoneware, covered with a thick glaze, may be the
most ancient description seen at the present day. The surface is covered
with a semi-opaque glaze which is called <i>c&eacute;ladon</i> by the French, and
which varies in colour from a russet grey to a sea green. The glaze of
this ware is frequently seen crackled all over in irregular lines, which
is termed in England <i>crackle</i>. This crackle china is the most esteemed
of Oriental porcelain, although it arises from a <i>defective</i> cause.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i312.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 330.&mdash;Bottle.</span><br /><i>Powder blue porcelain.<br />Ming dynasty.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 331.&mdash;Jar.</span><br /><i>Painted with plum blossoms.<br />Ming dynasty.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The same effect may be easily produced upon all terra-cottas of which
the paste is more sensible to the changes of temperature than the
exterior coating or glaze. In fayence this accident is of frequent
occurrence; the red porous clay, being more expansive, draws away the
enamel, which, being less elastic, is separated into fragments, and the
greater the resistance the more they are multiplied. Now one of the
qualities of porcelain is precisely to avoid this double action. Its
paste is composed of a felspathic rock, decomposed and infusible, called
<i>kaolin</i>; the cover or glaze comes also from a felspathic rock, slightly
crystallised; these melt and assimilate together <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>harmoniously in
vitrification, and a complete affinity is evident between the two
elements of porcelain. Nevertheless the Chinese, in modifying the glaze,
are able to render it more or less expansive and to break the harmony
between its own shrinkage and that of the paste or body which it covers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i314.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 332.&mdash;Plate.</span><br /><i>Egg shell porcelain.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hence the crackle, at the option of the potter, is made of large,
middling, or small size.</p>

<p>Various kinds of crackle are thus produced, sometimes upon one and the
same piece, as by exposing the porcelain or portions of it when at its
greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> heat to a sudden cold or contact of water, large fissures may
be obtained. These cracks are sometimes filled in with black, red,
chocolate, or purple colours.</p>

<p>Others may be classed among the curiosities of porcelain&mdash;for example,
cups or bowls which have an outer reticulated coating, pierced or cut
out into arabesques, completely insulated from the inner vessel, except
at the rim at top and bottom where it is joined; these have been used
for tea or hot liquids, and may be held in the hand with impunity,
notwithstanding the heat enclosed within it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i315.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 333.&mdash;Plate.</span><br /><i>Egg shell porcelain.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another variety consists in cutting or punching out pieces of the paste
or body of the ware in patterns before it is baked; the pieces so cut
out are small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> ovals like grains of rice placed in more or less numerous
stars, rosettes, &amp;c. The vase thus ornamented is dipped into the glaze
which fills up all these small holes, and then placed in the kiln. The
pattern, being much more transparent than the body of the ware, is
distinctly seen, but especially so when held to the light.</p>

<p>Another beautiful effect is produced by means of the glaze itself, which
is of a light or dark shade according to its intensity or thickness; for
example: a fish, animal, or other object is stamped incuse on the upper
surface of a plate, it is then filled in with a coloured glaze and
vitrified, and is consequently shaded according to the thickness of the
glaze on each portion of the design, the surface being perfectly smooth.</p>

<p>Vases are sometimes seen separated in the middle into two pieces (which
must have been cut while the clay was soft), the upper half being
completely divided from the lower half&mdash;in arabesques and dove-tail
patterns, in such a manner, that although separate, they cannot be
altogether removed from each other; the wonder is, that in the baking,
the edges in juxtaposition should not have become again cemented
together.</p>

<p>The Chinese themselves are great forgers, and endeavour to impose not
only upon the Europeans, but upon their own countrymen, many of whom are
great amateurs, and are willing to pay extravagant prices for ancient
examples of porcelain, especially if made by a celebrated potter.</p>

<h3>JAPAN</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">The</span> information concerning the origin of making porcelain in Japan is
very scanty. Dr. Hoffmann of Leyden published a history of the principal
porcelain manufactories in 1799, which is appended to M. Stanislas
Julien&#8217;s account of those of China: it was a translation from a Japanese
work. He says it was to a colony of Kor&aelig;ans established in the province
of Omi, in the island of Nippon, in the year 27 <span class="smcaplc">B.C.</span>, that the
introduction of this art was attributed. About the same epoch there
lived in the province of Idsumi, situated like that of Omi in the island
of Nippon, a man named <i>Nomino Sukun&eacute;</i>, who made, in pottery and
porcelain, vases and notably figures of the size of life, to substitute
for slaves, which it had been previously the custom to bury with their
masters. <i>Nomino</i> received as a recompense authorisation to take the
name of <i>Fazi</i>, in the Kor&aelig;an language <i>Patzi</i>, artist-workman.</p>

<p>Under <i>Sei-wa</i> (859-876 <span class="smcaplc">A.D.</span>) the number of fabriques increased considerably.</p>

<p>Under <i>Syun-tok</i> (1211-1221), a Japanese potter named <i>Katosiro-uye-mon</i>
commenced the making of small vases in which to preserve tea, but for
want of a better process he placed them in the kiln on their orifices,
which consequently appeared as if they had been used, and the vases were
little cared for. Desirous of improving himself in the art, <i>Katosiro</i>,
accompanied by a Bonze or Buddhist monk, visited China in 1211, with
orders from his Government to make himself acquainted with all the
secret processes of the manufacture, which was at that time brought to
so great perfection there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 335.&mdash;Fukurokuji.</span><br /><i>The god of longevity.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On his return, he made such important improvements in the composition
and decoration of porcelain that henceforth it became superior in many
instances to the Chinese, especially in the manufacture of the best
specimens, upon which much time and labour were bestowed. The porcelain
of Japan is very much like that of China, but the colours are more
brilliant on the fine pieces; it has a better finish, and the designs
are more of the European character, the flowers, birds, &amp;c., being
more natural, and the ky-lins, dragons, and other monsters less hideous;
the paste is of better quality and a purer white, especially in ware of
the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps the most beautiful of all the porcelain made in Japan is the
<i>egg shell</i>, so called because it is extremely thin and translucent, yet
so compact that it can be formed into large vases, as well as plates and
bowls or cups.</p>

<p>The small cups without saucers, which are usually placed upon
<i>pr&eacute;sentoirs</i> of lac, are seldom painted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> the exterior; but within is
frequently found a fillet of gold, and slight sketches in blue or gold
indicating the outline of a mountain, the sun, clouds, and a line of
birds taking flight, or sometimes animals, all in outline. On other
pieces are birds, flowers, and animals delicately painted in colours.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i323.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 340.&mdash;Flask.</span><br /><i>Satsuma ware.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The art has been continued to the present day; those beautiful and
extremely delicate cups and saucers, thin as paper, are frequently seen
covered on the outside with a casing of bamboo threads woven together;
the larger basins and covers are also made of equally thin porcelain.</p>

<p>All these are produced now, as they were in ancient times, at Imari, in
the province of Hizen. It is not in the village itself that these
manufac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>tories are established, but as many as twenty-four or
twenty-five are situated near the mountain of <i>Idsumi-yama</i>, whence the
kaolin is obtained of which the vessels are made.</p>

<p>Crackle china was made in Japan as well as in China from a very early
period, and was frequently painted with flowers, landscapes, and birds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i324.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 341.&mdash;Incense-burner.</span><br /><i>Imari porcelain. 18th century.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the late Sir Augustus W. Franks, K.C.B., &#8220;the ceramic wares
of Japan exhibit great differences in their composition, texture, and
appearance, but may be roughly classed under three principal heads: (1)
common pottery and stoneware,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span> generally ornamented simply by scoring
and glazing the surface; (2) a cream-coloured <i>fa&iuml;ence</i>, with a glaze,
often crackled and delicately painted in colours; (3) hard porcelain.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the first of these classes belong the wares of Bizen, old Seto,
Shigaraki, and other small fabrics, including the Raku wares. The
principal factories of the second class are Awata, Satsuma, and the
recent imitations of the latter at &Ocirc;ta and elsewhere. Among the
porcelain, the coarsest is that made at Kutani, but the most celebrated
fabrics are in the province of Hizen, at Seto in Owari, and Kiyomidzu
near Ki&ocirc;to.&#8221;</p>

<h3>PERSIA, SYRIA, AND TURKEY</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PERSIA</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">Siliceous-glazed</span> wares were produced in Persia at a very early period,
and the late Mr. C. Drury E. Fortnum, in his <i>Historical Treatise on
Majolica</i>, states that the decoration by means of metallic lustre was
practised in that country in the course of the thirteenth century, if
not long before. Glass-glazed bricks, tiles, and other wares, were made
in Babylon at a remote period, as well as in Assyria and Egypt; and it
is probable that the art of their manufacture spread into the
surrounding countries.</p>

<p>The Persian ware is principally decorated with blue and black. The
lustres are a rich orange gold, a dark copper colour, and a brass
lustre. The patterns upon the tiles and vases are similar, and consist
of elegant arabesques, foliage, and ornamented flowers, more or less in
imitation of nature. Among these we notice the tulip, the Indian pink,
the rose, and other flowers. The tulip in Persia is the emblem of
Affection, which is thus symbolised at the present day. The bowls and
vases are sometimes ornamented with fabulous birds, gazelles, antelopes,
hares, &amp;c., mixed with scrolls and foliage. The forms include
hemispherical and cylindrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> cups, vases, and bowls on conical feet;
common forms are a bottle with a very long neck, probably used to hold
wine, and ewers and basins, the former like a bottle with handle and
long spout, used especially for ablutions, the latter with a pierced
cover. The tiles being mostly made to cover walls, form continuous
arabesques when placed side by side. Chardin says of them, &#8220;In truth,
nothing can be seen more lively or more brilliant than this sort of
work, nor of equally fine design.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Persian fayence was probably the same as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> the Gombroon ware, which
was shipped by the English East India Company from a port of that name
in the Persian Gulf, where they formed their first establishment about
the year 1600, and whence the great bulk of Chinese porcelain was
exported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>It has long been a <i>vexata qu&aelig;stio</i> whether porcelain was ever made in
Persia; some say the idea is altogether chimerical, but M. Jacquemart
endeavours to prove that both hard and soft porcelain were made at Iran,
and has devoted three or four long chapters to the support of his theory
(<i>Les Merveilles de la C&eacute;ramique</i>).</p>

<p>The nearest approach to porcelain in Persian ware is a sort of siliceous
frit or fine stoneware, which possesses a very slight degree of
translucency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span> but is not true porcelain composed of kaolin and petuntse
like Chinese porcelain. Small creamy white basins, with the sides
pierced with slashes and filled with translucent glazes, are
semi-translucent and have the appearance of porcelain.</p>

<h3>SYRIA AND TURKEY</h3>

<p>Dr. Fortnum was of opinion that what is generally known as <span class="smcap">Damascus</span> ware
was probably made not only in that city but at Constantinople, Broussa,
and all the principal sites of manufacturing industry throughout Syria
and Asia Minor. It is distinguished by the great brilliancy of its
enamel colours, the principal of which are a deep lapis-lazuli blue,
turquoise, a vivid emerald green, a brilliant red purple, orange or
buff, olive green and black. The pieces consist principally of circular
dishes, jugs with long cylindrical necks and globular bodies, flasks,
&amp;c., and the best specimens were probably produced during the first half
of the 16th century.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 347.&mdash;Damascus Plate.</span><br /><i>Painted in colours.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Remains of potteries are stated to have been found at Lindus on the
Island of Rhodes, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span> one period all the ware of Asia Minor was
attributed to those works and was called Rhodian. The pottery actually
manufactured there appears, however, to have been of a somewhat coarser
character than that made at Damascus and elsewhere. Richly painted
tiles with diapering and conventional floral patterns under a vitreous
glaze were used largely for the decoration of palaces, mosques, and
tombs throughout Asia Minor and Syria; these tiles are also to be found
at Constantinople.</p>
